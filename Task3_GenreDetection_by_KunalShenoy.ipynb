It's 1935 in rural Opeongo County, Ontario. Henry, who still lives with his parents, is a hulking man, which belies his slow mental status more closely resembling that of a child in many respects. Although many in the county view Henry as harmless, those who not support that view look to his association with such people as Elvin, who believes angels live behind his eyes, and one-legged Mabel, who lives by her own code, as confirmation that he is a menace. Nine year old Verlin is Henry's nephew, the son of Henry's brother Ferris and Ferris' wife Minnie.

Caught in the middle is Ferris, who, like his and Henry's parents, loves and inherently trust him, but who wants to ensure Verlin's safety and happiness and wants to retain a supportive marriage with Minnie.\n",

            "ID: 136, TITLE: Flintown Kids (2005), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: The town of Flint, Michigan, a miniscule point on the map, recently drew national attention through documentary film maker Michael Moore. Moore, a Flint native, wrote and directed the documentary Roger and Me about the darker side of capitalism and General Motors. Omar McGee, another Flint native, picks up where Moore left off with Flint Town Kids, a documentary showing the African American dark side of Flint. Flint is predominantly populated by African Americans who migrated from the south after Reconstruction. Flint can be viewed as a microcosm of America's poverty stricken urban areas. Once abandoned by General Motors, Flint became one of the poorest urban areas in the country. Flint Town Kids captures the bleak setting in which these Flint natives exist. It powerfully examines the hardships, the sufferings, mishaps and sacrifices made in order to persist in this town. Flint Town Kids highlights the frightening education system in Flint where schools are designed to produce basketball players only. On the other hand, students who are non basketball players are left with mediocre excuses for classrooms while adjusting to the lack of libraries needed to empower young minds. The documentary takes a very close look at children who bare the armor of strength in trying to escape Flint.

For those who are not as fortunate to escape the nightmarish lifestyle that Flint brings, they embark on survival methods such as drugs and violence. Flint Town Kids brings to light the little faith left in the system. Children raising kids and kids age ten killing each other is just an everyday part of life in Flint. The documentary will depict those shocking scenes in the lives of children who are left with no choice but to make adult decisions in a world where only the fittest survive. For many adults the consuming goal of overcoming poverty lies in making cocaine. Flint Town Kids graphically explores this process which seems to have become the saving grace for many in a town that presents scarce positive outcomes for the future. Flint Town Kids will leave audiences outraged and enthralled with the African American lifestyle in an area that once presented promise only miles from the Motor City. Follow-up to Dollar Bill Y'All. Story revolves around the youth on the streets of Flint, Michigan and the choices they face. Several Flintown Kids grow up to be ballers, jumping right from high school to the NBA while others are faced to find other ways off the streets, like selling drugs and resorting to violence.

The hazards and consequences of this trade are explored, including the pan-African violence propagated by constant flow of weapons into the continent. If it is a \"survival of the fittest\" world, as Darwin concluded, then the capitalist interests that fund the gun runners are climbing the evolutionary ladder on the backs of the Africans in this stark Darwinian example. Much like the foreseeable extinction of the Lake Victoria perch, and death of Lake Victoria itself, the Africans are in grave jeopardy, even as they survive in the only ways they know how. In the 1950s or 1960s, the Nile perch was released into the Lake Victoria. In just a few decades, the large, voracious predator has all but eliminated the other species of fish, turning the lake into an ecological wasteland. \"But economically, it's good\" -- and indeed, perch fillet is Tanzania's best selling export to Europe. Fishermen, factory workers, civil servants, pilots of cargo aircrafts, delegates of the European Commission, communities living around Lake Victoria: plenty of people are involved in some way in this new industry.

He wanted his first project as producer to be told by Canadians about issues close to the Canadian heart.

Well-known psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud defines such a state of mind as Electra complex, a daughter's unresolved attraction to her father. Madhavi's married life does not find fruition as it is undermined by her cluttered psyche. She is overcome by jealousy and raises a storm when Nava, a foreign girl, comes to learn traditional paintings under Keshavarao. With her actions revealing her unnatural psyche, the family life collapses and her husband Vibhin finds himself in a quandary. Madhavi even fails to see her daughter Rachana's childhood cravings. The painful realization forces Keshavarao to find a way out of the family labyrinth. A few years later, Madhavi discovers that her father is in distant Kashi and goes searching for him. The eerie life of Kashi, the mysterious happenings, and the people longing for death in Mukthibhavan with the belief of attaining salvation, create a sense of disenchantment in her. She slowly begins to comprehend the incomprehensible. Man-woman relationship is of great profundity. It has defied the logic of philosophy, wisdom of spirituality and the inquisitiveness of psychoanalysis with all its subtlety and complexity which are beyond time and space. The mystery of the relationship caught the imagination of great philosophers and writers since the time of Sophocles, Aeschylus, Shakespeare, Kalidasa and has continued to mesmerize their forerunners living in the present times\n",

Skip started collecting these 16mm films many years ago, and he now has almost 17,000, crammed into almost every room in his house. His archive - one of the biggest of its kind in the United States - includes films from the 1940s, '50s, '60s, '70s and '80s on every conceivable instructional topic - sex education, personal hygiene, public safety, driver's ed, occupational training, the dangers of drugs and alcohol, religion, patriotism, how to be popular, etc. I was attracted to Skip because I find compelling his genuine affection for these \"orphan\" films, his obsession for collecting, categorizing and preserving them, and his passion for sharing them with the public at his A/V Geeks shows. The films in Skip's archive are campy, amusing and not a little propagandistic, but they're also valuable, fascinating time capsules that reflect America's social attitudes and cultural values throughout the last half-century.\n",

But soon after, mysterious and sinister events ensue: beatings, arson, explosions...

So he compromises both his profit margin and his principles and strikes a deal with the Russian mob. Although his high-tech scam takes off like a Sputnik rocket, jealousy (aka MARAT and his thug OLEG) threatens to bring it crashing down.

Boris has the money, Robert the inside information, so the two form a devil's bargain that leads to the destruction of Boris' rivals. From immigrant wunderkind to the Don of Brighton Beach, with all the perks, the dangers, and the responsibilities, Boris has made a speedy transformation. He marries the gorgeous gold- digger RACHEL and travels the world in search of the next, new 'naches'. But in the end, what equals success? What does Boris really have? Junkie friends, a bitch of a wife, snobbish in-laws who despise his roots. But for certain men of business, there is no cure. No matter how many candles they light in church, there is no forgiveness... and it is up to Boris to draw the line. But will he? And what if it is already too late?\n",

Carrying his burden over the fragile wires, he saves her amid the frantic cheers of the populace. The grateful mayor makes him a welcome guest, and he soon wins the heart of the young girl, but he has yet to obtain the father's consent.

At last he plucks up his courage and goes to the mayor. The latter is friendly to the young man, but he compels the rope dancer to leave with a vague promise for the future.

A snake has escaped and its body bars the way to the entrance to the tower. The snake tamer has, in her mad jealousy, forgotten all about her duties, and this negligence now proves fatal. Erna implores her in vain to call back the reptile, as she is the only one that can do it, but Ula Kiri will not listen to her in her storm of jealousy and hatred. But Erna overcomes all difficulties. Her great love teaches her what to do, and thus she saves her sweetheart. The mayor can no longer withhold his consent to the marriage and the same evening the Flying Circus goes away to the other regions, leaving a happy couple in the country town.\n",

            "ID: 448, TITLE: Guidance Is Internal (2016), GENRE: short, DESCRIPTION: Two people find themselves on the precipice of romance. Their personal convergence parallels NASA's exploration of space and echoes of JFK's once and future dream. Specifically the Apollo 11 voyage to the moon and JFK's 1962 speech ennobling cosmic quests are entwined with our characters' encounter. The micro and macro of human life are showcased through cross-cutting techniques. Both narratives underscore our film's essential theme; that love is the essence of all exploration and it is indeed the greatest adventure of all. Space exploration of all scales is born out of our internal need to connect externally. The title, \"Guidance is Internal\", was originally uttered during the Apollo 11 launch countdown and serves as a thematic bridge between the two stories. On one hand, we have two characters whose internal desire to connect catalyzes their external actions to communicate. On the other hand, we have the culminating efforts of humanity literally reaching for the stars in hopes of better understanding our place in the universe. Ultimately, what does each existential excursion into the unknown grant us? An understanding that we are not alone. For our two characters, their connection is forged by a mutual understanding and feeling for life. For the human race, witnessing our planet from the heavens imbues in us with an understanding of our innate interconnectivity. In both cases, a greater harmony is achieved.

            "ID: 449, TITLE: NorTec (2001), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: At the dawn of the twenty-first century, the Nor-tec phenomenon emerged from the border city of Tijuana and through the Internet, quickly conquered a global audience. Marketed as a kind of \"ethnic\" electronic dance music, Nor-tec samples sounds of traditional music from the north of Mexico, and transforms them through computer technology used in European and American techno music and electronica. Tijuana has media links to both Mexico and the United States, with peoples, currencies, and cultural goods--perhaps especially music--from both sides circulating intensely within the city. Older residents and their more mobile, cosmopolitan-minded children thus engage in a constant struggle with identity and nationality, appropriation and authenticity. Nor-tec music in its very composition encapsulates this city's struggle, resonating with issues felt on the global level, while holding vastly different meanings to the variety of communities that embrace it. With an impressive hybrid of musicology, ethnomusicology, cultural and performance studies, urbanism, and border studies, this documentary explores all facets.\n",

            "ID: 698, TITLE: From Orphan to King (2005), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: For fifteen million years orangutans roamed tropical forests from China to South East Asia. In Borneo, one of their last island outposts, lives one today who is a legend. He's won more than just a kingdom, he's won human hearts. They gave him the name Kusasi. The Orangutan King is the story of Kusasi's life told to us by a remarkable witness. Dr Birute M. Galdikas has been researching orangutans in Borneo for over 40 years. Under the guidance of Louis Leakey, Galdikas joined Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey to become a pioneer of Great Ape field research. Together they were known as the 'trimates', or 'Leakey's Angels'. Yet while Goodall's chimpanzees and Fossey's gorillas were made familiar through films, the orangutans are still largely unknown to television audiences. Their solitary lives high in the tree canopy have made them difficult to follow and film. Now, for the first time, Dr Galdikas will draw audiences deep into the orangutan universe. With enthusiasm and insight she tells us this special story - taking us back 30 years and unfolding Kusasi's story with detail, energy, and the wonder that she still feels for the orangutan species. As a three year old orphan, Kusasi fell under the care of Galdikas in her forest research camp. But driven by a cunning and tenacious spirit Kusasi did not behave as the other ex-captive infants. From the moment he arrived until today, Galdikas has watched Kusasi fight to win back and then succeed at life in the wild. And he's achieved what had once seemed impossible, reaching the top of the power hierarchy and ruling for ten years. The people who work at Camp Leakey enjoy his charisma, and even those who only visit him in his forest kingdom are struck with awe. As Julia Roberts was in 1997. Her encounter with Kusasi was unplanned - becoming a tight clinch with an irritable 140 kilo beast, possessing the strength of ten men. But she was unharmed. Kusasi is not malicious, and he's respected as much for his indifference to humans as for his power over the other orangutans. Today his spirit still burns brightly but his physical strength is fading. His fights with the rogue males who cross his borders are weakening him and The Orangutan King is the last chance for us to see him in power. But the hope of this film is that he will not be the last of his kind to rule with such strength in his forests. If the forest destruction can be stopped, there is a long future for the considerable Kusasi bloodline.\n",

After being suppressed and told what is normal by religious institutions for long periods of history, people today can speak their mind and practice alternative beliefs as they wish. They are not fearful of any repercussions or any stigma attached. They are Spiritualists, and Spiritualism is here to stay. Memoirs of a Medium looks at the current spiritual revolution from the perspective of the people involved. We tell the true life story of Sean Conway as he comes to understand that he is a spiritual medium. Sean was just like any child growing up in the seventies, coming from a large family in a small house in Sligo. He spent his days exploring the countryside with his identical twin brother Liam. All seemed well by day, however by night Sean was being visited by strange visitors, people from the distant past. Petrified by fear, Sean told others of his experiences, but they fell on deaf ears. With nowhere to turn, not even his twin brother, he began to feel isolated and decided to not speak of it. Only when he meets Asha, his spiritual mother, does he discover his true calling, spiritual medium-ship. With change however, came resistance, from both his inner self and also the people around him. We explore how after first being frightened of ridicule, he now uses his gift to help others. Reflecting the complexity of medium-ship and spirituality as a religion, academic experts and grassroots activists explain this shift in beliefs and tell us what they are exactly. They tell of the benefits certain people gain from medium-ship. Shot on location in Ireland, Memoirs of a Medium reveals this new spiritual revolution. It asks what is a medium and how does one become one?\n",

The film begins by tracking the expedition of the project's lead zoologist across the entire length of Iceland, taking in an amazing landscape of waterfalls, glaciers, hot springs and geysers and spending a day with a rural Icelandic family living on the country's north coast, only a few miles from the Arctic Circle. He then travels by ship to the only inhabited island in the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago, located off of Iceland's south coast. Here, the zoologist is joined by a handful of colleagues, who set to work on the steep coastal bluffs to humanely capture and crate for air transport to the U.S. several dozen newly-born, downy puffins. The film then shifts to Chicago, where the birds are held in quarantine at a remote site while the final touches are being put on the new building and seabird habitat they will live in. Here we join the building's architect and engineer as they guide us through the unique design, construction, and layers of complex technology and machinery required to create in terrain, temperature, and lighting of an exacting replica of Iceland ideal for the North Atlantic puffin, but located in the heart of Chicago's cityscape. Finally, the film records the puffins' arrival, veterinary examinations, and climatic entry into their new home that, for nearly 4 million zoo visitors per year -- and on a busy day, more than 200 busloads of city school children -- will provide a \"window to a world\" they've only heard of or read about in textbooks.\n",

Curtis has taken the unedited rushes of everything that the BBC has ever shot in Afghanistan - and used them in new and radical ways.

But nothing is as simple as it seems in a film that has more twists and turns than a mountain road - David has secrets of his own, including a tortured past that even he doesn't fully remember or understand, and a burgeoning love affair with Laura Watson, the new girl in town, who may also be more than she seems. Also in the mix are vampire hunters - Dr. Simon Polidori and his daughter Miranda, who have an agenda of their own, which involves using David as bait for Langstrom. Meanwhile, David's best friend and business partner, Oliver Seward, thinks that David is going a bit nuts, but he remains steadfast, even when called upon to help combat a creature that he doesn't really believe exists. Finally, there are Langstrom's victims - Emily Parker, a girl David meets at a bar in Toronto... Amanda Doyle, the deputy mayor of Harker's Cove... and Stephanie Fielding, a young lawyer who specializes in \"real estate\" exclusively for one client. All of them are just pawns in her game, as she maneuvers everyone towards a final showdown which was prophesied centuries before.

But do we understand the obstacles to peace? The documentary film, \"Shadows - When the Past Rules the Present\" raises the controversial question: \"Is the legacy of Holocaust the stumbling block of peace, and can the traumas of the past be broken?\" For two years the director followed four leading members of the Israeli peace movement, while racism has grown, peace failed and the gap between us and them widened. The documentary offers unexpected insight: An influential rabbi builds bridges to Muslims and Jihadists. A former prominent politician who turned his back to power is now, as a debater, working for peace. A historian who calls the government's Holocaust teaching \"pure pornography\" and a psychiatry professor reveals the abuse of the hidden and inherited traumas in society. These positions, which we rarely hear about in the media, are gradually changed during the documentary, as peace again collapses. Shadows of the past and present are taking over, and step by step we see the four main characters facing a reality, they can't control. It is a close up view of people caught by fear and doubt. A controversial and universal story about the stumbling blocks of the past and its influence in the present and the future. The questions raised by the director are far from her Scandinavian background, in matters of conflicts, traumas and religion. 'Shadows - When the Past Rules the Present' is questioning if holocaust is an obstacle to peace between Israel and Palestine. Four prominent Israeli Jews, critical upon the abuse of the legacy, are caught in doubt and fear for the future of Israel.\n",

Professor Barstow, a chemist and college friend of Donaldson's, invites the lawyer to his laboratory to witness the end of an experiment with a mysterious poison which is supposed to act fatally exactly seven days from the time it is taken, leaving no trace or clue. To Donaldson's amazement, he sees the dog selected for the test drop dead at the end of the seventh day. Fascinated he steals some of the poison and returns to his home. There he drinks the poison at twelve o'clock noon, on June 1. Immediately after he engages a suite at a fashionable hotel, and invests a good part of his savings in a wardrobe. Then he enters a high priced café. Ellen Arsdale and her brother Ben arrive for dinner. The nervous actions of young Arsdale attract Donaldson. He scents something unusual and follows him. Arsdale sends his chauffeur into the hotel on an errand, and with his sister in the car, starts away at a rapid speed. Donaldson succeeds in jumping on to the running board and finally overpowers Arsdale and stops the machine. Then he is told by Ellen that her brother is suffering from opium, the curse of several generations of Arsdales. Donaldson accompanies them home, where Ben succeeds in escaping. At Ellen's urgent request, Donaldson pledges himself to find Ben. He enlists the aid of his friend, Police Inspector Saul, and then begins a search of Chinatown. During the night the home of Ruth Chester, a friend and neighbor of the Arsdale's is robbed. Detectives find a handkerchief left by the thief embroidered with the initials \"B.A.\" This evidence is presented to Inspector Saul and he concludes that Ben is the thief. Donaldson and Ellen go to the Arsdale country home the following day, believing that Ben had gone there. They detect the odor of opium as they enter. It leads them to the attic where Donaldson is attacked in the dark. Before he recovers the assailant escapes. Unsuccessful, the company returns to New York. Exhausted, Donaldson goes to his hotel and sleeps through twenty-four hours without waking. On dressing, he is handed a note from Ellen stating that Ben has returned home, secured more money and again escaped, after saying something about \"Wun's place.\" This is a Chinatown den, previously visited by Saul and Donaldson. The young suicide hurried to Mott street, and in Wun's parlor finds Ben, stupefied by drug. He takes him to his hotel. Then he notifies Ellen. Then Donaldson discovers that he has fallen in love with the charming young girl and is about to declare himself when he recalls the death awaiting him. He leaves suddenly without offering to explain his strange conduct. Next morning learning that Ben is to be arrested for the robbery, Donaldson confesses that he committed it and is arrested. In his cell he writes a farewell note to Ellen, expressing confidence in Ben's ability to overcome his weakness. This letter was delivered by Saul at Donaldson's request. Marie, the Arsdale housekeeper, hears Saul give his name and title to the maid and flees to the attic, where her son, Jacques, is in hiding. Confident that Saul is there to arrest him, Jacques attempts to escape. Ben overhears the noise and captures him, with Saul's assistance. The inspector searches Jacques, and finds part of the jewels stolen from the Chester home. Triumphant, he takes Jacques to headquarters and frees Donaldson. Almost crazed with remorse over his act in taking the seven day poison, Donaldson returns to Barstow's laboratory. While awaiting Barstow's arrival, he discovers, hiding under a settee, the dog whose death he had witnessed seven days before. Barstow arrives and explains that the poison failed. \"Let me have him,'' Donaldson pleads. \"He has taught me the value of life.\" Taking the dog in his arms he returns to the hotel, and begins packing his things. There Ellen and Ben find him. Ashamed now of his cowardice, Donaldson hesitatingly explains about the poison. Ellen's affection, prompted by sympathy, increases, while Ben begs Donaldson to help him with his strength and determination in his fight against the drug.\n",

            "ID: 14861, TITLE: Symbiofaerietaxiplasm oder die Feen von Hadres (2015), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: Symbiofaerietaxiplasm is an experimental documentary on the beginnings of the radical faerie movement in Austria. It follows the appropriation of a queer subculture that emerged in the 1970s San Francisco gay scene in an contemporary austrian environment. The film team collaborated with the faeries from 2012 to 2014. During that time faeries found their place in Lower Austria, but also invited the international faerie community to the first international Faerie gathering \"The Sound of Faeries\" in the alps. The film shows the faeries at public events, their faerie shows, everyday live at their sanctuary, their gathering and various ceremonies. It also appropriates their artistic ways to express central issues of the movement in a cooperative manner. Taking the faerie idea of creative- and experimental spaces and their potential for self-development very serious the movie adopts open artistic forms, making experimental use of the cinematic space. Instead of a linear narration the movie consists of 7 chapters and 4 interludes all focusing on different kinds of articulations. One central question of the faerie movement also poses an interesting challenge to the filmic form that the movie embraces: How can we express ourselves without falling back to the false security of objectivity and its corresponding norms? The movie relies on a similarity of art and people in taking them serious as insolvable riddles that keep us engaged in a fruitful process of interpretation. Whatever truths are to be found in this movie emerge from the collective interaction of all people involved.

It's the beginning of the Korean conflict era, when most are uncertain about if there will be a war and if so if the Americans should get involved. The Greers, who live in Greenhill, a small American everytown, are as concerned as anyone. They own a family operated contracting business - an essential service - and thus those in power at the company, such as eldest son Martin Greer, the business' primary engineer, are probably immune from the draft. Martin had already served for the country during World War II, where his brother Riley Greer was killed, and which followed in the footsteps of his father, Thomas Greer, who proudly served during World War I. Martin's wilder younger brother, Jack Greer, has a trick knee which will also probably exempt him from military duty, which suits him just fine as he is more obsessed with a young woman named Carrie Turner. Others in town, such as George Kress, look to Martin to write letters for their loved young men (in George's case, his namesake son, who everyone calls Junior) to state that they are indispensable in their work, which Martin is unwilling to do. When the conflict escalates into an American involved war, everything changes. All the Greers have to examine their true feelings about war, about this war, and if it would be any different if their loved ones or themselves were not involved.\n",

Think of the women and girls you know and love: they can be any age, friends, co-workers or family. Now... consider the fact that 1/3rd of all women and girls worldwide are assaulted during their lifetime. That means one of every three females you know personally most likely has been attacked, and chances are they didn't fight back. Why is this, when females of other species would? \"Beauty Bites Beast\" sets out to answer this question and vanquish the barriers to teaching women and girls unarmed verbal and physical empowerment self-defense, while focusing on some of the surprising benefits: confidence, leadership, and self-esteem.

He's an academy award winning filmmaker, and age hasn't shaved the edges off his journalistic impulses. Calling it the \"swan song\" of his career, John embarks into production on a road trip and takes no prisoners - confronting the best and worst a documentary production can throw at the aging director. John first meets his crew in Liverpool, England, introduced by his cinematographer and longtime friend Michael Savoie. \"When you're working with John Zaritsky, your best move is to listen to what it is that he wants, and try and help him get it,\" Michael confides to the camera. This turns out to be the best advice to hold to, as the crew bear the 71-year-old's force of personality to complete his final documentary. Outrage drove John to finish his two prior films about Thalidomide's disastrous legacy, and in making \"No Limits: The Thalidomide Saga\", it serves him one last time. John is a social justice crusader; and it's easy to admire his desire to defend the weak and downtrodden. But with John's total lack of regard for bureaucracy, budget constraints or the 'authorities', the crew find themselves led by a man who's passions sometimes exceed their own. Dogged by long days, language barriers and various production hiccups, the people supporting his vision come to realize the cost of doing business with John Zaritsky. The chance to make a great film - the \"big bang\" as John calls it - is tempered by a level of devotion to a man who is frequently uncompromising on set. In this behind-the-scenes film, documentary lovers are treated to a journey into the often underappreciated aspects of filmmaking. It begs the question: why would someone make documentaries, when the process is so punishing? For John Zaritsky, he appears incapable of doing anything else. Mr Zaritsky On TV is a candid, funny portrait of a lion in the winter of his life as he tries to reclaim his place in the filmmaking landscape.\n",

            "ID: 15049, TITLE: Can Architects Save the World? (2015), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: \"Can Architects Save the World?\" In this 52-minute documentary, a museum exhibition of architectural models inspires thoughts about whether architects, and architecture, are becoming more prominent in our lives. The exhibition showed models for projects around the world designed by BIG, the international firm founded by well-known Danish architect Bjarke Ingels. Washington DC's National Building Museum displayed the models in an unprecedented way, suspending BIG's models in the air, around the second floor of the building's spectacular Great Hall, in an exhibition entitled \"Hot to Cold\" that ran from January-August 2015. Interviews with the exhibition's curators, and with architects, urban planners, and architecture critics, suggest that forces in society today -- forces like climate change, competition for residents between suburbs and cities, and an increasingly design-literate public -- are making architects more prominent. As a result, the design-thinking process used in architecture could become part of how society solves some of its complex problems -- problems that the political process often seems too gridlocked to solve on its own.\n",

A steelworker, newspaper COLUMNIST, blues musician and others movingly recall their journeys up Hwy. 61 to Chicago in search of comparatively well-paying factory jobs. On the South Side they built a vibrant city-within-a-city of thriving black businesses and civic institutions, proudly referred to as \"Bronzeville.\" They recall that after World War II increasingly self-assertive and prosperous blacks led a bitterly resisted struggle to open up fair housing opportunities outside the ghetto. But just as the American Dream was coming into reach for some, the steel mills and stockyards closed, leaving newer immigrants trapped in decaying public housing projects and inner-city despair.\n",

The film focuses on the efforts of both the survivors and those creating the Bataan Death March Memorial to pass on the story of the Bataan Death March. The film follows the making of the sculpture and the impact it has on the survivors. By letting the survivors themselves recount the events of the March, this film preserves first-person accounts of the unimaginable conditions these men experienced. Through the creation of the sculpture meant to honor them, and the transformation of this memorial from an idea to a reality, this film weaves a tapestry of the lives of all involved. We'll travel from the foundry in Berkeley where the sculpture is born into it's full size and scale, to the homes of survivors in Los Angeles, El Paso and the towns of New Mexico. Most crucial is the effort to tell the story that so many grand children and great-grandchildren of survivors do not know.\n",

There only seems to be one way out for him. Surprising, Dardennesque debut by producer Serrano. Somewhere in a Spanish city, Santiago (in his 30s and played by the Mexican painter Bosco Sodi) roams aimlessly and lonely through the streets. His wife has thrown him out and the judge has decided that he cannot see his children for now. Santiago tries to put his life back together again from this unfortunate situation. He has a job in a friend's bar, but is given the sack. Little by little, his life falls apart. The camera (impressive work by David Valdeperez) follows him roaming the streets looking for work and for an aim in life. His only way out seems to be the highest bridge in the city... Scriptwriter and novice director Carlos Serrano Azcona (1969) previously worked on \"Japon\" by Carlos Reygadas, who is co-producer this time, as is the Spaniard Jaime Rosales, director of e.g. \"Bullet in the Head\". The form and style of \"The Tree\" were partly inspired by the work of the Dardenne Brothers, but Serrano Azcona was also influenced by the possibilities of modern video cameras, as previously revealed by Albert Serra (\"Honour of the Knights\") and Rafa Cortes (\"Yo\"). The result is a dynamic yet restrained and contemplative film. The Tree opens the eyes of the viewer to everyday despair and existential hope, culminating in a climax that has to be seen to be 'believed'. (ID/GT)\n",

            "ID: 15335, TITLE: Cooked (????/II), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: In Cooked, filmmaker Judith Helfand takes audiences from one of the most extreme heat waves in US history deep into the politics of disaster. In 1995, 739 Chicago residents - most of them poor, elderly and African American - died over the course of one hot July week. Inspired by the award winning book \"Heatwave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in Chicago,\" by author, sociologist and native Chicagoan, Eric Klinenberg, the story of this deadly week becomes a journey into the disaster behind and below the disaster. Persistent and pernicious, it started long before the heat and had almost nothing to do with the weather. In the wake of the heat crisis, Dr. Steve Whitman, Chicago's Chief Epidemiologist, correlated heat deaths to zip code. His findings were as stark as they were resonant. Where poverty was greatest, death from heat was greatest. This analysis prompts Helfand to explore our nation's prevailing definition of \"disaster.\" She seeks out crisis experts - at a Disaster Preparedness Conference, in meetings with emergency managers and at a multi-state earthquake drill - all focused on predicted natural disasters. This investigation into the business of disaster politics weaves in and out of a parallel (albeit very different) world of disaster preparedness taking place on Chicago's South and West Sides, the same neighborhoods that saw the most heat deaths in 1995. Helfand starts to follow a new brand of \"first responders\" - community health activists, grassroots economic development practitioners and urban agriculturalists racing to rescue their neighborhoods from the \"unnatural disaster\" taking place everyday. Cooked juxtaposes and interweaves these stories, with Helfand asking a driving question: Can we redefine \"disaster\" to include extreme poverty?\n",

His nights are simpler, as he sits in his bedroom surrounded by the things he values the most: his pet goldfish and the musical drawings he hangs on his walls. As Daniel sits there alone, he often hears the quiet notes of a piano drifting through his window as the young woman down the street practices. On a night that would change the rest of his life, Daniel wanders down the street to meet this young woman named Kenna, and to show her that he has written down the music she was practicing. He offers to show her where she's making mistakes, revealing for the first time that despite his handicap, he has an amazing gift. Concerned for him, Kenna tries to convince him to go home, but when her college roommates and their rowdy friends return, things go terribly wrong. Confused and agitated by the hectic activity and the ridicule of a college prankster, Daniel finds himself fleeing, running blindly into the path of an oncoming car seemingly killing him.

As his skills develop, Daniel marshals the courage to ask Kenna out for an evening. What follows is a night on the town ranging from intimate exchanges on the grandiose steps of the historic town courthouse, where Daniel learns that Kenna is suffering from a terminal disease, to a \"Grease\" style dance off at a downtown nightclub. As the night comes to a close, Daniel recounts the unique nature of his new life and falls asleep for the first time since the accident weeks earlier. Days later, not having heard from him, Kenna finds Daniel sitting in the park he used to visit so frequently. But something is horribly wrong. He has aged twenty years since the time she had last seen him, and suddenly they find their fates tragically aligned.

Set in modern day India, SWADES tackles the issue facing the citizens of this nation at grassroots level. The India of SWADES is colorful, heterogeneous and complex and it is to this environment that Mohan Bhargava [Shah Rukh Khan], a bright young scientist working as project manager in NASA, returns to, on a quest to find his childhood nanny.What begins as a simple mission prompted by nostalgia and affection turns into a journey to the heartland of rural India, both literally and metaphorically. Mohan finds his nanny, Kaveriamma [Kishori Ballal], the symbol of motherhood, in a village called Charanpur with an admirable young woman Gita [Gayatri Joshi] and her younger brother Chikku [Master Smit Sheth]. Mohan begins to interact with the Panchayat, which has at the helm the dogmatic but the just village chief. Along the way he encounters the quirky but endearing Mela Ram [Dayashanker Pandey], who sees Mohan as his ticket to the chain of restaurants he will start on the American freeways. Mohan befriends the local postmaster Nivaran [Rajesh Vivek], stuck to his old-fashioned ways, and the village children, whose future is inextricably linked with that of the country. Soon, Mohan finally realizes that it is his scientific temperament as well as his understanding of societal complexities that can drive the villagers to participate in a movement to better their lives. Of East Indian origin, Mohan Bhargav is one of the millions of Non-residential Indians settled in the United States of America. Mohan is employed with N.A.S.A., and has been assigned to the task of measuring precipitation, which he accepts. He gets a little homesick, and reminisces about his life in India, his late parents, and his nanny, Kaveriamma. He impulsively decides to travel to India, and see how his nanny is doing. He finds out that his nanny has re-located, and after several inquiries he finds out that she lives in Charanpur - a place famous for the actual markings of the footsteps of Lord Ram and Devi Maa Sita when they were on their 14-year exile from Ayodhya. Mohan does locate Kaveriamma, who is overjoyed to see him. She introduces him to a young woman by the name of Gita, and Mohan gets attracted to her. This attraction gets him involved in the many problems facing Charanpur, and he decides to lend a hand to ease them. But will a young educated man like Mohan be accepted by the villagers, and will be considered competent enough to adjust to their way of life? A man searching for clues to his past pays a visit to the place where he was born in this drama laced with romance and music from India.

While searching for Kaveri, Mohan becomes reacquainted with Gita, one of his friends from his school days who has stayed behind to serve the community as a teacher. Gita thinks little of Mohan's desire to bring Kaveri back to the United States with him, but she also finds herself struck by the charm and intelligence of the adult Mohan, and the two develop a strong infatuation. But many in the community have little regard for Mohan's accomplishments in the United States until he steps forward to help his old neighbors by revamping the village's antiquated electrical system.\n",

The conference included discussions, collaborative writing sessions, and visits to museums, shrines, and cultural sites and culminated in a collaborative BOOK of ghazals (a poetic form employed by Rumi), prose reflections, and translations composed by participants as a homage to the spirit of international exchange. Participants met with Esin Celebi Bayru, Rumi's great granddaughter (21 generations removed), visited the Rumi Shrine and the shrine of his mentor, Shams e Tabris in Konya, and traveled to the southern town of Karaman to explore a village where Rumi once lived with his family.

It follows the raw story of a man who overcame a life of drugs and violence to become a rebel of hope, waging a 13 year war to free enslaved children. Sam Childers grew up in the hills of Pennsylvania. His parents were decent folk, but at an early age, Sam started to show a knack for getting into trouble. His father, a former marine, grew fond of saying, \"Boy, somebody's gonna kill you one of these days!\" By his early teens, he was constantly in trouble. Whether it was fights, drugs, or married women, Sam slid deeper into a life of violence and crime. He eventually became a 'Shotgunner' - an armed guard for drug dealers. It was during this stage of his life when he met Lynn, a stripper, who would later become his wife. Haunted by his father's words, he became increasingly concerned that he was going to be killed because of his lifestyle and began to distance himself from it. He found a job in construction and prospered, despite his continuing drug and alcohol habit. Lynn, meanwhile, returned to the Church she had forsaken as a young adult. Sam also sought to re-establish his relationship with God and began to live a clean life. Lynn gave birth to a healthy baby girl and Sam started his own construction business. Little did they know that their greatest challenge was just around the corner. In 1998, urged by his Pastor in America, Sam arrived in war-torn Southern Sudan with a mission group to help repair huts damaged in the conflict. One afternoon, he stumbled across the body of a child, torn apart by a landmine. He fell to his knees and made a pledge to God to do whatever it took to help the people of Southern Sudan. God sent him a message back: Build an orphanage for the children, and build it here. The local people thought he was mad. At the time, the Lord's Resistance Army, a brutal rebel militia that had kidnapped scores of children and murdered hundreds of thousands of villagers, was laying waste to the area. Sam was adamant and held fast to God's mandate. He would build the orphanage there! Slowly the orphanage began to take shape. During the day Sam cleared brush and built the huts that would house the children. During the night, he slept under a mosquito net, with a bible in one hand and an AK-47 in the other. Sam began to lead armed missions to rescue children from the LRA. It wasn't long before tales of his exploits spread and villagers began to call him \"The Machine Gun Preacher.\" Thirteen years later the orphanage is one of the largest in Southern Sudan and has fed and housed over 1,000 children. Today around 200 children call the orphanage home. Unfortunately, there are still many Sudanese children suffering and in need of rescue.\n",

When Detective Brent Garner's home was burned down and he was brutally and sadistically attacked, the Palmerston North community was terrified. Who wanted Garner dead, why, and who was next?

            "ID: 23456, TITLE: Sunshine Hotel (2001), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: The Bowery: for centuries it has been one of New York City's major arteries, in every sense of the word: a gritty and vital counterpoint to the theaters of Broadway and the mansions of Fifth Avenue. Traditionally a rowdy avenue of nickel museums and burlesque shows, by the beginning of the 20th century it had become America's most famous 'skid row', lined with flop houses, missions, and bars. Only a few decades ago, these flophouses served as a nightly refuge for 25, 000 men on the fringes of society: the poor, the wretched, the overwhelmed; some scoundrels, but more of them decent men whose luck had simply failed them. Today only a handful of the old flophouses remain, the rest having been swept away in an implacably rising tide of affluence. These flophouses are the last vestiges of a different time and a different city, and the Sunshine is one of them. At the Sunshine Hotel, nothing has changed in seventy or eighty years. The men still sleep in a warren of 4' x 6' cubicles called pigeon coops, which stand only 7' high beneath 12' ceilings, covered over with chicken wire. The narrow gray hallways are lined with flimsy wooden doors. Behind every door you'll find a man, and a story. Nathan Smith is the manager and a resident of the Sunshine Hotel. He has lived on the Bowery for some twenty years. Nate spends his days at the Sunshine in the \"cage\", as the front desk is called, or in his room, chain smoking, writing, trading stories, and dreaming of getting off the Bowery. An engaging and articulate man, he is the central character of Sunshine Hotel. We also meet several of the other residents of the Sunshine: army veterans, recluses, drinkers, transvestites, philosophers. We see the toll that life has taken on these men, but we also see how the hardship of life at the Sunshine does breed a particular wisdom, humor, and resilience. This is real life. Not every resident of the Sunshine is a paragon of virtue or a fount of homespun wisdom. But in a society which feels increasingly less responsible for its less fortunate, in which they have become dehumanized to the point of being invisible, a day at the Sunshine Hotel is a pointed reminder that every strand in the fabric of the City is a part of the whole; and that every time one of those strands is removed in the name of civic improvement, something essential is lost.\n",

            "ID: 23484, TITLE: America's Lost Landscape: The Tallgrass Prairie (2005), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: America's Lost Landscape: The Tallgrass Prairie tells the rich and complex story of one of the most astonishing alterations of nature in human history. Prior to Euro-American settlement in the 1820s, one of the major landscape features of North America was 240 million acres of tallgrass prairie. But between 1830 and 1900 - in the space of a single lifetime - the tallgrass prairie was steadily transformed to farmland. This drastic change in the landscape also brought about an enormous social change for Native Americans; in an equally short time their cultural imprint was reduced in essence to a handful of place-names appearing on maps. America's Lost Landscape examines the record of human struggle, triumph, and defeat that prairie history exemplifies, including the history and culture of America's aboriginal inhabitants. The story of how and why the prairie was changed by Euro-American settlement is thoughtfully nuanced.

A B-52 Stratofortress carrying two Mark 39 nuclear bombs broke up in mid-air, dropping its nuclear payload in the process. The two 3-4 megaton nuclear bombs separated from the gyrating aircraft as it broke up between 10,000 and 2,000 ft. One of the bombs activated, causing it to execute many of the steps needed to arm itself, such as charging the firing capacitors and, critically, deployment of a 100-foot-diameter retard parachute. The bomb that descended by parachute was found intact, and standing upright as a result of its parachute being caught in a tree. According to the bomb disposal expert responsible for disarming the device, the arm/safe switch was still in the safe position, though it had completed the rest of the arming sequence. The Pentagon claimed at the time that there was no chance of an explosion and that two arming mechanisms had not activated. In 2013, information released as a result of a Freedom of Information Act request confirmed a single switch prevented detonation.\n",

In a supermarket, the kind of building to which the techniques of low-cost mass building have been successfully applied, she meets an old friend and they fall in love; they look for somewhere to settle down. Investigating the utopian architects Constant, Buckminster Fuller and the Archigram group she finds that their ideas have all failed to affect the housing economy, and that only 28% of house buyers in Britain would consider buying a new house, and that at the current rate of building, each house now standing in Britain will have to last for more than 5,000 years.

It was a time when music was reinventing itself to appeal to a younger, more discriminating audience. New Wave, Punk and other experimental genres were finding a ready audience and were changing the shape of music forever. Yet, Miami's influential rock artists were one of the nation's best-kept secrets. Relegated to the southernmost tip of the state, the scene was largely overlooked and eventually forgotten. Until now.

The event culminated in South Florida's biggest reunion concert. The film chronicles the remarkable true story of South Florida's influential rock music scene by combining dozens of exclusive interviews, live performances by the bands, and vintage video, radio broadcasts and photographs.

Reproductive rights advocates refer to these as \"TRAP\" laws, or Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers. While these laws have been enacted in 11 states, Southern clinics, in particular have been hit hardest and are now in a fight for survival. In Texas, less than half of the clinics open in 2013 are still functioning. In Alabama, three clinics struggle to keep their doors open. And in Mississippi, just one abortion clinic remains. Some of the most common requirements with which clinics struggle to comply include: requiring physicians to obtain admitting privileges from local hospitals for any doctor performing abortions, requiring that clinics undertake expensive renovations such as widening hallways by a few inches to accommodate wheelchairs and gurneys they will rarely use, and requiring other regulations usually reserved for hospitals even though abortion providers rarely require such a high level of care. But even in this hostile environment the doctors, clinic owners and staff refuse to give up. Trapped interweaves the personal stories behind these regulatory battles: from the physician who crisscrosses the country assuring medical services are available; to the strong women and men who run the clinics; to the lawyers leading the legal charge to eliminate these laws; to the women they are all determined to help. In this feature length character driven film, our main characters fight alongside a dedicated cadre of attorneys to preserve abortion rights in a country living with the mistaken belief that Roe v. Wade still protects a woman's right to choose. U.S. abortion clinics are fighting to survive. Since 2010, hundreds of bills have been enacted targeting abortion rights on a statewide level. Trapped follows the clinic workers, women, and lawyers on the frontlines of the battle to keep abortion safe and legal for the millions of poor and uninsured women caught in a political quagmire.\n",

Even hardcore wine enthusiasts can't resist discovering new flavors and odors in rediscovered beer styles.

He begins questioning his life choices, which ultimately turns into an art form, as he goes from architect to playwright, examining his own life. This is a quirky relationship drama. It's New York, 1979. Gabriel Richmond is a talented architect with a seemingly rich life as he has a caring wife, loving daughter and life long friends. Yet, he spends most days in the movie theater, hiding out from work, escaping into a fictional world where he can more readily relate to the made up characters. When fiction shines a mirror on his own life, an inspired Gabriel begins writing a play not-so-loosely based on his reality, examining all of the relationships that make his life what it is. At first a hobby, the play begins to consume Gabriel's own self-examination. Slowly he realizes the fragility of his relationships and overall decisions in life, but does not know what to do with this information other than write about it. Gabriel's work eventually gains momentum just as his real life begins to fall apart. Equipped with a hand-held tape recorder and typewriter, he begins a journey to re-author his own life, looking back on the pieces of his fractured self. He begins to see that life is not always as controlled as a play or movie and sometimes the best thing an author can do is let the characters speak for themselves. Emblematic of the self-discovery that was hatching in New York (and many other cities) at the end of the 1970's, Multiple Sarcasms shines a light on not only Gabriel's life, but also the complex people that make it up.

Uncovering the secret identity of the dream killer and his connection with the children of Elm Street, the girl plots to draw him out into the real world. In the early 1980's, a psychopath named Fred Krueger - known as the Springwood Slasher - murdered several children with a glove outfitted with straight razor blades attached to the fingers. When a foolish decision by a judge sets Krueger free, an angry mob of parents, whose children he terrorized and murdered, burn Kruger alive in the boiler room where he worked. Years after his death, the living children of the parents responsible for Krueger's death (including Nancy Thompson, daughter of the police officer who arrested Krueger) experience terrifying nightmares involving a burned man wearing a glove with razor blades on the fingers.

            "ID: 23867, TITLE: Concealment (2012), GENRE: short, DESCRIPTION: CONCEALMENT is a short conceptual film that provides a commentary on morality of the world of female advertising. It explores the vulnerability of a model as she moves through the constructed world she performs in, making the audience re-examine their perception of perfection. CONCEALMENT would ideally be presented as an installation with two opposing screens facing each other. This hopefully forces the viewer to stand and be torn between them. It creates a tension between two extremes: the female as object - a seductive relationship with the audience like a perfume commercial, and secondly, the female as subject - a more critically aware 'real' presentation. This more truthful presentation deconstructs the illusion of the seductive screen and reveals the impossibility to the audience. Each screen loops on its own time schedule and therefore the relationship of each screen to the other is not synced and is in fact uncontrolled. The results will always be different - depending on when the viewer enters the space. The two different soundtracks (string music harmonics vs. detuned sine waves and pure tones) are also looped on their own time schedule that doesn't match either of the screens, so a different combination will always be heard. This potentially develops a more heightened aesthetic experience through rhythm and communicating more effectively than a single screen piece might have done. It is retaining the political agenda by eliciting a suitable relationship with the audience through the mode of presentation. It is making the piece discordant both physically, visually and sonically. CONCEALMENT is a conceptual film that provides a commentary on morality of the world of female advertising. It explores the vulnerability of a model as she moves through the constructed world she performs in, making the audience re-examine their perception of perfection.\n",

            "ID: 23929, TITLE: Bhutan Height of Happiness? (2009), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: The tiny kingdom of Bhutan is hidden away in the Himalayas and dwarfed by its giant neighbours, India and China. While the rest of the world pounds the treadmill of economic development, Bhutan continues on its somewhat alternative path, pursuing the ultimate goal for its people: happiness. In a recent survey, 97% of the Bhutanese declared themselves to be happy. But why? The kingdom's guiding principals are based on the Buddhist belief in the sanctity of life and the preservation of nature. \"If everyday you are surrounded by smoke, dust and pollution you cannot say that you are happy\", explains Dr Tenzin, Minister of Labour and Human Resources. \"If you forget your own traditions and philosophies, then you will not have a true happiness.\" For most of the 20th century, there were no cars, telephones or post offices to allow communication with the outside world. Then, in 1992, the first few tourist visas were granted. \"The king knew very clearly that he should introduce high value and low impact tourism\", states Rinzin Ongdra. Even today, the number of tourist visas granted is carefully limited. Bhutan's unique approach to modernity leaves a lasting impression on its Western visitors. \"You feel the serenity wherever you go\", states one woman. \"There is definitely a gross national happiness feel about the place.\" But the big change came in 1999. Amidst much controversy, Bhutan became the last country in the world to allow television in. \"A farmer got a television for the first time and all the villagers around came to have a look\", recalls Ugyen Wangdi. \"They spent the whole night awake watching television and couldn't get back to their work in the morning.\" The impact on the sheltered society has been profound. People who had previously been content with so little suddenly felt they needed the best product. \"Before, you picked the toothpaste that was available and were pretty satisfied with it\", states Chime Wangdi. Now \"even rural women are very conscious of how they should do their hair and what they should apply on their face\". Following a surge in teenage violence, the government decided to ban all channels considered to be a dangerous influence on their peaceful way of life. After watching wrestling on television, \"children used to fight among themselves, just like what is happening on the wrestling\", states Chimi Dorji. Others started dressing; \"like the hip hop stars in the States\". \"I think we are going headlong into some of the very same mistakes of other countries and societies,\" fears Chime Wangdi. Already there are signs; \"safety networks of caring for each other, of community, harmony, of communal feeling, all those are breaking down.\"\n",

            "ID: 23934, TITLE: \"Playing Shakespeare\" (1982), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: In 1979 Trevor Nunn, then artistic director of Britain's Royal Shakespeare Company, devised a two-part television workshop to consider the art and technique of acting in Shakespeare's plays. He was joined by RSC co-founder and Associate Director John Barton and a group of the leading actors of the day, including Alan Howard, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Jane Lapotaire, David Suchet, Michael Pennington and Terry Hands. The programs were co-produced with London Weekend Television and broadcast on consecutive Sunday evenings as part of the South Bank Show series, collectively titled \"Word of Mouth.\" Four years later Mr. Barton greatly expanded the series with nine additional installments, which he hosted. To the roster of actors were added Tony Church, Sinead Cusak, Mike Gwilym, Susan Fleetwood, Sheila Hancock, Lisa Harrow, Ben Kingsley, Barbara Leigh-Hunt, Richard Pasco, Norman Rodway and Donald Sinden. Three episodes featured extended turns by leading lights Judi Dench, Roger Rees and Dame Peggy Ashcroft. The entire series was simply filmed on a small sound stage with rehearsal props and costumes. An invited audience attended, scattered about on folding chairs. Much the action consists of Mr. Barton directly addressing the viewer, outlining a particular point which the actors then attempt under Barton's coaching. Lively discussions of the seemingly endless permutations of the bard's output are a particular delight. [The DVD's consist only of the nine additional episodes.]\n",

            "ID: 23984, TITLE: Flock of Dodos: The Evolution-Intelligent Design Circus (2006), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: The highly anticipated, comic and controversial feature documentary, \"Flock of Dodos: the evolution-intelligent design circus,\" is the first feature film to take an even-handed look at the intelligent design vs. evolution clash that appeared on the covers of Time and Newsweek in 2005. Filmmaker, scientist, surfer and evolutionary biologist Dr. Randy Olson explores the controversy over the teaching of evolution and the recently developed alternative, intelligent design. Olson, a native of Kansas, visits his home state and the community of Dover, Pennsylvania, which attempted to introduce intelligent design in science classes. Olson draws on basic aspects of evolution as metaphors, including the extinct dodo, which he suggests symbolizes what happens to those unable to change with their environment. Featured are seven top advocates for intelligent design, including Dr. Michael Behe, author of \"Darwin's Black Box,\" fourteen evolution Ph.D.'s, a poker game among eight evolutionists, a rabbit eating its own poop, and a flock of animated dodos playing poker, dancing, and helping the audience answer the question, \"who really is the 'flock of dodos?'\" Though writer/director Randy Olson is a self-proclaimed evolutionist, this film truly does treat both sides of the issue with respect. Olson is from Kansas, where the Intelligent Design controversy was born, and interviews all the major names in Intelligent Design (John Calvert, Michael Behe, and Jack Cashill to name a few). The genius in Olson's movie is in never settling into a \"PBS-style\" science documentary. The frame of the film never gets weighted down by boring science lectures or obfuscating intellectuals. The film, instead, hangs it's hat on hilarious dodo animations, slick graphic sequences, and a humorous yet honest approach to the whole topic. \"Flock of Dodos\" will truly have people on both sides of the issue quoting the film in the theater lobby.\n",

            "ID: 23986, TITLE: Up the Down Staircase (1967), GENRE: drama, DESCRIPTION: Sylvia Barrett is a rookie teacher at New York's inner-city Calvin Coolidge High: her lit classes are overcrowded, a window is broken, there's no chalk, books arrive late. The administration is concerned mainly with forms and rules (there's an up and a down staircase); bells ring at the wrong time. Nevertheless, she tries. How she handles the chaos and her despair in her first semester makes up the film: a promising student drops out, another sleeps through class, a girl with a crush on a male teacher gets suicidal, and a bright but troublesome student misunderstands Sylvia's reaching out. A discussion of Dickens, parents' night, and a mock trial highlight the term. Can she make it? Fresh out of graduate school, Sylvia Barrett begins her teaching career as an English Literature teacher at Calvin Coolidge High School, located in a tough inner city neighborhood in New York City. The school is overly bureaucratic and disorganized, with forms needing to be completed for every small task (why would an English teacher be required to fill out a basketball requisition form?), keys allocated to teachers even for things that do not exist, lack of supplies or people to fix broken items, overcrowded classrooms, and staircases labeled as up and down. This bureaucracy is designed to deal with the chaos that exists both within the staff and student body. Despite these problems, Miss Barrett comes into the school with an idealistic view of being able to assist students in learning, regardless of obvious or hidden obstacles. Some of the students who may be facing some of these obstacles are moody but bright Joe Ferone who is always on the verge of expulsion, romantic but socially awkward Alice Blake, and Roy Hackett, whose surrogate mother pleads on his behalf for Miss Barrett to pass Roy despite him continually falling asleep in class. Miss Barrett's fellow English teacher, Paul Barringer, who is the center of attention of many a female student and who has aspirations of getting out of teaching to become a novelist, tries to advise Miss Barrett not to take her job so seriously. Through it all, will the school get the better of Miss Barrett or will she get the better of the school and the students?\n",

            "ID: 24028, TITLE: My Prague Spring (1993), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: A Film Journey into the Soul of The Czech Republic In its \"velvet revolution\" of 1989, the people of Czechoslovakia toppled its communist dictatorship and embraced democracy and capitalism. By January 1993, the country had peacefully split in two. Today, Prague streetcars emblazoned with Coke and Marlboro ads glide past Benetton boutiques and McDonald's restaurants. Some Czechs worry that the country is being taken over by Germans and Americans. But the sheer beauty of this Renaissance, Baroque and Gothic city shines through any onslaught of commercialism. In the early 1990's, thousands of American college graduates began flocking to Prague, where they could postpone entering the \"real world,\" and live cheaply in a beautiful undiscovered European city. Throughout that decade more and more tourists crossed the statue-lined Charles Bridge in search of old world beauty-- previously hidden by communist isolation. Don't miss the bridge, especially at night when the lights of Prague Castle glint off the river, and the tunes of street buskers float in the evening air. But what of the people who cross the Charles Bridge on their way to work every morning? Who are the Czechs? What is their history? What is their future? Most tourists who visit Prague and the Czech Republic know little of the people who call this historic place their home. My Prague Springis an award-winning film that vividly humanizes a resilient people who have survived a tumultuous history. In the spring of 1990, a Czech-American filmmaker spent four months living with his Czech relatives, and opened an intimate window into an uncertain world. This unique moment in time -- when a country stood between its communist past and its capitalist future -- is available on DVD (see link at right). Winner of the Gold Award at the 1993 Houston International Film Festival, My Prague Springwas also named Best of Festival: New Visions Documentary at the 1994 Berkeley Video Festival.\n",

As the bass begins softly, the images start to move up along a vertical line, apparently reflecting the path of an elevator. Everything is transparent, everything is structured: The scaffolding is echoed in the picture's frame, which rolls across the screen in a way similar to a poor film projection, offsetting the illusion of movement. Or the images accentuate the music through superimpositions, short zooms and shots through cloudy glass. A small model of the Statue of Liberty then briefly disorients the viewer, and the vertical movement becomes horizontal, moving from Tokyo to Kyoto: Analogously to the laid-back drum'n'bass, the images then begin a relaxed and aimless journey through Japan's urban spaces. In this phase, the two elements almost unite, in smooth parallel movement. Near the end, the rhythm materializes in the human body. Three kids break-dance in a city park and are then joined by others. While this is not an arrival at a certain destination, it is definitely more than a chance meeting. The escalators at a large train station continue to run mechanically, and the space does not come to rest until the music has faded away. (Dominik Kamalzadeh)\n",

With a few months left in his sentence, thirty-eight year old convict Randall Patrick McMurphy - \"Mac\" - serving time for several assaults and statutory rape, has just been transferred from a labor camp associated with Eastern Oregon Correctional Institution in Pendleton to a psychiatric hospital. Mac has been able to use acting \"crazy\" - having a belligerent and smart-alecky attitude and anti-authoritarian behavior - to his benefit in not having to do any work. He is at the hospital as the authorities at Pendleton want him to undergo a psychiatric evaluation to prove he is not crazy, believing this is all an act to get out of work. He believes this stint will get him out of any more work while he serves out the remainder of his sentence. He is placed in a ward with a group of men who have differing degrees of lucidity and control of their mental faculties.

The film reconstructs the events leading up to the summer of 2014, when Kleiman was scandalously dismissed. \"Cinema has the ability to turn people into citizens.\" Only a few film excerpts are needed to grasp why Kleiman is such an admired film advocate and enthusiast: like his allies Erika and Ulrich Gregor of Berlin's Arsenal cinema, Kleiman knows how to use film as a weapon in the fight for better, more open societies. It's thus fitting that while this film looks back on an impressive, courageous life, it first and foremost documents why Naum Kleiman's understanding of cinema in today's Russia can hardly be surpassed in terms of force and topicality.\n",

            "ID: 38116, TITLE: The Turns of the Wheel (1998), GENRE: short, DESCRIPTION: \"The Turns of The Wheel\" is an awarded experimental movie which captures the spirit of 'renku', classical Japanese chain poetry, in the form of image and sound. This movie, or renku, consists of 18 verses. Each of these verses has an own life and might be considered as a single 'haiku', classical Japanese short poem. These haikus were first created on a storyboard, much like an action sequence or shot sequence in a film. However, the structure of each storyboard, in this particular case, followed the rhythm of the classic Japanese poetry. Director Karl Neubert's intention is to reveal characteristics of human nature by juxtaposing the rigid rhythm of the classical poetry and the apathy of modern Japanese society. The film's issues represent current social conflicts, such as generation gaps between parents and children shown in the 'Retrospection' sequence; sexual problems like harassment often seen in the workplace in 'Servitude'; impotence or emasculation either caused by social or environmental deterioration in 'Ascent'; and inequality in gender roles in the 'Corruption' sequence.

They had the courage to perform a fusion of traditional Brazilian rhythms with psychedelia at a time when the \"MPB\" (the Brazilian music establishment) were openly hostile to the wild sounds of American rock 'n roll, provoking even further outrage by fashioning their own handmade musical instruments, constructed out of such common household objects as rubber hoses, cans of hot chocolate, or bottles of bug spray. Os Mutantes was regularly censored by the government while performing alongside such musical revolutionaries as Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso (who, like many artists in Brazil at the time, were imprisoned and exiled for their political stance). Amidst such oppression, it's a miracle their records survived the decades and are considered such a great inspiration to many of today's best artists.\n",

            "ID: 43720, TITLE: Pablo Neruda! Presente! (2004), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: A dynamic documentary on Latin America's most renowned poet, Pablo Neruda (1904-1973). Neruda was a public poet, statesman, activist, and Nobel Laureate who attained mythic stature in his lifetime. An incurable romantic, incorrigible womanizer, and unrepentant militant communist, Neruda's contradictions found poetic expression in an aching lyricism and potent political verse. He invented a new poetic voice, distinctively Americano, rooted in Latin America's native cultures and untamed geography. Neruda wrested poetry from the rarified atmosphere of the salon and gave it to the people, a communal voice rooted in oral tradition, fired by raw passion and the struggle for justice. \"Poetry is like bread,\" he wrote. \"It should be shared by all, by scholars and peasants, by all our vast, incredible, extraordinary family of Man.\" Compelling biography represents an idea larger than its individual subject-in the case of Neruda, the theme of el deber del poeta, the poet's calling. For Neruda, poetry was a rallying cry for the social function of art, a way of bearing witness to suffering and injustice. Chile's tumultuous history shaped Neruda, and he became a major player in its ongoing political struggles with military dictatorship, fascism, national liberation, and U.S. intervention. The poet lived through some of the most significant events of the 20th century, and his writing is a chronicle of the times, poetically expressed, from the Spanish Civil War to the Stalin purges, the Cold War, and the 1973 military coup that toppled Chile's democratically elected government. Neruda reclaimed \"America\" in the name of the entire continent and redefined the cultural landscape. Pablo Neruda! Prensete! creates an intimate portrait of one of Latin America's most colorful characters, and introduce a broad North American audience to the power of Neruda's poetry.\n",

The youngest of four children, Isidore (aka Poet-o) was born in Central Park on Sheep Meadow field in 1920. At the age of five Isidore was placed in institutions after his mother was put into a psychiatric institute and his father left for Arizona with the family's money. He lived in various Foster homes until the age of 16 when he was left alone in the streets. Since then, Isidore, best known today as Poet-o, has been entertaining the visitors of Central Park by reciting his own poetry and by giving wishes out with his famous Unicorn Bell. To this day, Isidore has written more than 1000 poems and met millions of people who come every years to visit Central Park. He has also performed in various off-Broadway shows in New York. Poet-o is famous, but as he told us often, famous in a very strange way. Famous but very poor. He survives thanks to the generosity of the Central Park's visitors who buy his poems for a few dollars.

            "ID: 43783, TITLE: Dark Mirror of Magick (2001), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: \"This is the most remarkable record of a supernatural event I have ever witnessed. \" - Wayne Darwen, Director. On January 3rd, 2001, documentary writer/producer Wayne Darwen brought a professional TV news crew into the Temple of the O. T. A. to visually record a remarkable event: the summoning of the ancient spirit Vassago. On February 1st, the Los Angeles affiliate of a National TV Network broadcast an edited version of Vassago's Prophecy, confirming that the Spirit had predicted a major news event. Only 13 days after the ritual was visually recorded, President Laurent Kabila of the Congo was assassinated! In this video version we show you the entire operation in sequence, exactly as it happened with no rehearsals and no retakes. Wayne Darwen also interviews the Magister Thabion (Poke Runyon) and the mystic seer Frater Solomon. Their unrehearsed answers to his probing questions leave no doubt as to the philosophical depth and spiritual power of Solomon's ancient Magick even in this modern age. In \"The Magick of Solomon\" video we dramatically reenacted magical rituals for instructive purposes, whereas \"Dark Mirror of Magick\" is the record of an actual magical operation of historical significance. We believe that this remarkable documentary will be studied and commented on for years to come. This 2011 edition has ten more minutes of new footage added with commentary on the Vassago Prophecy, as subsequently revealed in the following two years, plus a new prophecy from Vassago himself. Viewer discretion is advised, do not engage in these practices without the supervision of an experienced adept.

            "ID: 43785, TITLE: Huguette Oligny, le gout de vivre (2013), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: J'ai réalisé en 2009 un film sur mon pčre, intitulé Gratien Gélinas, un géant aux pieds d'argile. Grâce aux archives, j'ai pu faire revivre celui que l'on surnommait Ťle pčre du théâtre québécoisť. Il était décédé dix ans auparavant et, dans les derničres années de sa vie, il avait perdu tout contact avec la réalité. Alors qu'il était encore lucide, je n'ai jamais pris le temps de capter sa parole, sa réflexion sur la vie. En mars 2011, la seconde épouse de mon pčre, la comédienne Huguette Oligny, alors âgée de 89 ans, quittait son appartement pour aller vivre en résidence. Je connaissais Huguette depuis prčs de 50 ans. Aprčs le décčs de ma mčre, elle est entrée dans ma vie et, au fil du temps, j'ai noué avec elle une relation intime et chaleureuse. Je craignais que, confrontée au déracinement de l'entrée en résidence, elle perde la force de vivre. Au contraire, sentant la mort proche, ma belle-mčre a ressenti ce passage comme une libération et sa vision des choses s'est transformée. Sa parole aussi, dégagée de l'autocensure qu'elle s'était longtemps imposée. D'entrée de jeu, elle m'a fait cette révélation étonnante: ŤJ'ai passé le temps oů l'on veut tellement paraître, paraître - Non, c'est fini, ça. Je ne veux plus - Quand on est jeune, c'est trčs important. Mais quand on est trčs vieux, qu'on a un pied dans la tombe quasiment, paraître pour quoi, pour qui? Non, paraître, c'est terminé pour moi!ť Ma chčre comédienne n'avait plus d'image ŕ défendre. Elle était passée de l'autre côté du miroir. Elle me parlait sans détour de sa foi, de ses souffrances passées, de ses amours, mais surtout de son profond goűt de vivre. De la sentir sereine, transparente, lumineuse m'a profondément touché, et je me suis demandé si ce miracle serait possible devant une caméra. Afin que d'autres que moi puissent découvrir le sourire de celle qui, ŕ la fin de sa vie, se sentait la plus heureuse du monde. Un tournage intime, presque secret, a alors débuté. Lors de mes visites, pendant dix-huit mois, j'installais rapidement caméra et micro. Sentant que le temps était compté, je m'avançais sur une glace trčs mince avec une vieille dame qui avait déjŕ un pied dans l'éternité. Comprenait-elle que je faisais un film? Cela lui importait peu. Elle profitait de chaque instant passé avec moi, elle m'aimait comme ma mčre m'aurait aimé. Elle m'ouvrait son coeur, et j'y découvrais son indéfectible amour de la vie, malgré les épreuves qui l'avaient marquée. Pour cette comédienne qui avait souvent incarné des rôles de mčre, la maternité était devenue un calvaire lorsqu'elle avait été privée de ses enfants pendant neuf ans. Et cela, elle n'en avait jamais parlé publiquement. Avec l'accord de ses enfants, Anne et Jean Alexandre, j'ai pu révéler un passé familial douloureux qui avait laissé des traces, męme s'il était maintenant loin derričre. Ŕ cette quęte intime, d'autres voix se sont ajoutées. Celle de son amie d'enfance, l'écrivaine Marguerite Lescop qui, ŕ 97 ans, fait la preuve que l'énergie et la passion n'ont pas d'âge, que l'amitié n'a pas de fin. Celles de Françoise Faucher, Françoise Graton, Janine Sutto, Gilles Pelletier et Gérard Poirier, qui m'ont rappelé la fragilité du souvenir que laisse un comédien aprčs avoir peuplé notre imaginaire pendant plus d'un demi-sičcle. Et combien il n'est pas facile de quitter un métier qui vous passionne toujours. Durant ces rencontres tournées par mon ami le cinéaste François Laliberté, je ressentais une grande fierté de recueillir leur parole, forte, précise, colorée. Ŕ travers eux, j'avais autant l'impression de filmer notre histoire collective que celle de ma belle Huguette. Durant ce tournage, il y a eu des instants de pur bonheur, comme la découverte de cette mélodie composée par André Mathieu pour sa muse Huguette. Il en était tombé amoureux en 1943, et lui avait envoyé une lettre écrite sur une portée, qu'elle recevrait 65 ans plus tard. Un moment d'émotion rare oů, pour la premičre fois, grâce au pianiste Alain Lefčvre, j'ai pu entendre avec Huguette un homme qui dit en notes l'amour qu'il a pour une femme. La vieillesse n'est pas toujours triomphante, et j'ai voulu la montrer pour ce qu'elle est, sans maquillage. Pourtant, lŕ aussi, des miracles se produisent. Aprčs avoir résisté de tout son ętre ŕ l'entrée en résidence, Huguette a été conquise par le magnifique rocher qu'elle voyait de sa fenętre. Et il est devenu un ami ŕ qui elle parlait tous les jours. J'avais en tęte la magnifique chanson de Sylvie Tremblay, Je chanterai pour elles, une caresse dans les cheveux blancs de celles qui ont bercé nos enfances. Et je recevais en cadeau un vibrant message d'espoir, essentiel, enveloppant comme la chaleur des braises. Oui, j'ai filmé l'âge de braise de ma chčre comédienne. Elle est décédée trois mois plus tard, ŕ l'âge de 91 ans. Je lui laisse le mot de la fin: ŤMon Pascal. Ça t'embęte que je t'appelle comme ça? Tu n'es pas n'importe qui. Tu es trčs précieux pour moi. Je te parle comme ŕ mon enfant, avec vérité, du meilleur coeur - Je suis, ŕ l'âge que j'ai - un âge plus que respectable - la femme la plus heureuse du monde. Je suis complčtement heureuse. Je nage dans le bonheur. L'âge me convient parfaitement. Quand on arrive dans la vieillesse, on se rend compte que la vie est tellement courte, tellement brčve, tellement pleine - Et alors, donner ŕ de beaux jeunes gens comme toi le goűt de vivre, quelle plus belle récompense est-ce que je peux espérer de la vie? La vie, la vie - Quel cadeau que la vie, hein? C'est incommensurable. Qu'est-ce qu'on attend pour ętre heureux?ť Pascal Gélinas a réalisé Huguette Oligny, le goűt de vivre, un film monté par Josiane Lapointe et produit par Pauline Voisard, des Productions Triangle. Il a remporté le Prix de la meilleure biographie au 31e FIFA, ŕ Montréal. Il est distribué par Radio-Canada.

            "ID: 43829, TITLE: \"Blockbusters\" (1987), GENRE: game-show, DESCRIPTION: An updated version of the popular early-80's game show of the same name. While the original used pairs of family members as contestants, this version used a simpler, one- on-one format. Presented with a grid of hexagons, each with a letter printed on it, one contestant had to make a horizontal line of five hexes, while his opponent tried to make a vertical line of four. For each chosen hex, a general knowledge question was asked, the answer to which began with the letter printed on the hex. Whoever gave the correct answer to the question got control of the hex and could choose the next hex to be used. Based on the popular 1980 game show, in this revamp version, the \"family pair\" had been dropped, and 2 contestants competed in a best two-out-of-three game match, 1 a returning champion, the other a challenger, competed to connect hexagons by answering trivia questions that started with each letter on a 4 X 5 computerized grid board. All letters in each of those hexagons were all 1-word answers to questions, relating to them. Also, instead of challenging questions, this updated version would feature a question in 2 parts: one is a series of suggestive questions by Mary Ellen, Hellouise, among many others and the second is the normal question on which the answer had been given right away. In Round 1, the challenger (red) had the advantage first, by connecting, top to bottom, in as few as four moves, as the champion (white) has the disadvantage by connecting side by side, in as few as five. In Round 2, the advantage switched as the champion (white) connected, top to bottom, in as few as four moves, while the challenger (red) had the disadvantage of connecting, side by side, in as few as five moves. If 2 contestants came close to each other (in paths on the board), after the last contestant picked the letter (in which one team whose path was connected and the other blocked), then the final sudden death question will be asked. If in an event of a tie, a tie-breaking round is used on a 4 X 4 computerized game board that gave nobody the advantage (meaning that the challenger (red) needed to connect, top to bottom, in as few as four moves, as the champion (white) needed to connect, side by side, also in as few as four moves). The champion played the Gold Run bonus round, where they had to make the connection side by side, connecting the gold to the gold on a 4 X 5 computerized board in 60 seconds, by answering rapid-fire questions about that/those initial(s) to win a flat $5000 (before the jackpot that started at $5000 plus $5000 for each time it was not won). The Gold Run's answers consists of 1 to 5 letters whose words start with those initial letters on each hexagon, represents a person, place, thing, phrase, event, etc. Correct answers on a hexagon turns gold while wrong answers or passes turns the hexagon black \"block\" and the contestant had to work their way around that block. If a contestant failed to make that connection or was completely blocked in, then he/she is rewarded $100 for every gold hexagon that a contestant had.\n",

Not overlooking the deeply entrenched reality of the developing world, the film presents the illicit adhesives market with a sense of urgency and intricacy, bringing awareness to a growing global giant but also providing a framework for change.\n",

This program focuses on such different topics as: obsessive cleaners who live with extreme anxiety at the thought of dirt; people who become hoarders as a result of bereavement and other traumas; and the perils of breathing in dust and unknown particulate matter, which might even be toxic. Hoarders find it easier to let their things go if they donate to charity, rather than throwing them into the skip. Linda Dykes of Abergele, Wales, known as the \"Queen of Gleam,\" has an obsessive-compulsive need to clean. She has a team who help clear Britain's public spaces of graffiti and of over two million pieces of litter that are dropped outdoors each day. The program shows Linda and her squad clean up a Victorian underpass in Redhill, Surrey. Volunteers include Cheyza Burch and friend Michele, who provide humor and drama in a scene in which they use an industrial-strength jet washer to clean the brick walls of grime. Next, she calls in specialists to cover the walls with anti-graffiti paint. After four hundred man-hours of labor, the tunnel is re-opened to the public, and a crowd of locals praise it highly. Other cleaners assist hoarders around the U.K. to bring tidiness and sanitation into their lives.

When she sees the bathroom, the poor woman vomits. However, four days later, Frank's house is gleaming. 22-year-old hairdresser Adam Cannell is obsessed with symmetry and balance. He volunteers to help Helen, who lives in Buckinghamshire with her dog and two cats. She says that life is too short to spend cleaning her house. When Adam enters, he is shocked, and Helen says, \"I can tell that you're totally out of your comfort zone.\" When he finds to his horror that the cats used the carpet as their latrine, Helen shrugs it off. Adam asks Helen when the last time was that she saw her bedroom floor, and she has to think about it. He asks her whether she gains anything from not throwing old stuff out, and she admits, \"It's a negative gain, in that I don't have to cope with throwing things away.\" But after four days, the chaos is gone, and Helen's son is amazed during his visit: \"I can hear an echo! ... It really does feel twice the size.\" Helen vows to begin a regular cleaning regime. It's a happy ending for everyone involved.\n",

            "ID: 43945, TITLE: Shadows in Paradise: Hitler's Exiles in Hollywood (2008), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: By 1939, 30,000 intellectuals and radicals were exiled from Europe, 80% were Jewish. These dramatic events sent many of the greatest minds of the 20th century into exile in the United States The manna of creative intensity that hovered over Berlin in the 20's, - in music, art, theater and film -that glow of aesthetic productivity was extinguished. In some ways, Los Angeles in the 30's and early 40's may be seen as its afterglow...when scores of exiles, fleeing the upsurge of European fascism, briefly transformed Southern California into one of the capitals of world culture, and profoundly altered the horizons of American music, literature, and the arts. What drew them to California? The balmy Mediterranean climate that always had been an attraction for those in cold Northern European climates. Los Angeles offered Hollywood with its tantalizing opportunities for employment. Most importantly, the attraction of so many others who had already settled there offered its own magnetic pull. Many musicians found work in the movie studios. Their influence was not so much in the mass culture of the movie studios, but in the universities, in concerts and the musical sophistication of the city. Thomas Mann wrote, \"Exile creates a special form of life, and the various reasons for banishment make little difference - the sharing of a common fate are more fundamental than such nuances of opinion... and people find their way to one another. . All of German literature had settled here,\" Thomas Mann was in many ways the center for the German intellectuals - albeit not always a popular one - his aloofness and arrogance saw to that: \"What is homelessness? My home is in the works that I take with me. They are (German) language and style of thought, the traditional treasures of my country and people. Where I am, there is Germany.\" Mann wrote Doctor Faustus and Joseph and His Brothers in L.A., became an outspoken public figure, speaking out against the dangers of Fascism, and the reality of what was happening to the Jews of Europe. Despite his initial euphoria about the cultural prospects of Southern California, Max Reinhardt found himself expected to punch a studio timeclock like any factory worker. In 1942 he left dejectedly for New York City. Many of the arriving professionals were forced to downgrade their professions-- musicians becoming chauffeurs, concert pianists becoming piano tuners. A story often repeated by the exiles: \"Two dachshunds meet on the palisade in Santa Monica and schmooze about their fortunes. \"Here, it's true, I'm a dachshund, but in the old country I was a Saint Bernard!\" Brecht arrived, broke, in need of work, and set himself up as the unshaven working man- embarrassed bourgeois intellectuals, who were ripe for his satire, especially the aloof and haughty Thomas Mann, keeper of the great German intellectual flame. Brecht, who lived in Santa Monica, chose to remain a stateless person, an exile in waiting, a passer-by, a man on the run.\n",

            "ID: 43962, TITLE: Angry Monk: Reflections on Tibet (2005), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: Tibet - the mystical roof of the world, peopled with enlightened monks? Only one of them wouldn't toe the line: Gendun Choephel, the errant monk who left the monastic life in 1934 in search of a new challenge. A free spirit and multifaceted individual, he was far ahead of his time and has since become a seminal figure, a symbol of hope for a free Tibet. A rebel and voluble critic of the establishment, Gendun Choephel kindled the anger of the Tibetan authorities. The cinematic journey through time portrays the life of this unorthodox monk, revealing a face of old Tibet that goes against popular clichés. The film makes an abundance of unique and rare historical footage available to the general public for the first time. But it does not dwell on the past; rather it skilfully oscillates between tradition and modernity. Archival images of ancient caravans and monasteries give way to scenes of discos and multi-lane highways in Lhasa, where pilgrims prostrate themselves as they circle the holy temple. ANGRY MONK offers a fascinating insight into a country whose eventful past is refracted in the multiplicity and contradictions of everyday life. Ultimately, this road movie also tells the story of a man who left home to search for something that could have liberated traditional Tibet from its rigidity. An outsider who was always open to new things, he eventually became a stranger in his homeland and homeless in foreign lands - a wanderer between worlds.\n",

            "ID: 43967, TITLE: S&man (2006), GENRE: horror, DESCRIPTION: S&MAN begins with footage from Michael Powell's exploration of voyeurism, \"Peeping Tom.\" Director JT Petty uses this footage as a starting point to examine the classic comparison between filmmaking and voyeurism, particularly within the horror genre. He goes on to investigate this connection further, but rather than looking to classic horror films, Petty explores the seedy underground genre of fetish films. These movies are basically simulated snuff films where victims are raped and murdered in a variety of fantasy scenarios. The most notorious of these is a series called \"S&Man,\" where voyeurism takes center stage as people are unknowingly followed with a camera. Petty plunges headfirst into this world of bizarre fetish films, and comes up with mesmerizing interviews with the producers and actors of these movies. Much of the footage from these videos will shock and disturb even the most seasoned horror veteran. However, the connection that Petty draws between these films and mainstream horror classics like \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" and \"Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer\" proves even more unsettling. Using interviews with Carol Clover (author off the definitive horror book, \"Men, Women, and Chainsaws), and his personal experience as a horror director, Petty suggests that viewers' interest in horror films is rooted in the same voyeuristic urge to which these fetish videos appeal. Ulitmately, Petty directly confronts the audience, forcing them to examine their fascination with horror, torture, and violence. And for genre fans, these implications may make S&MAN the most unsettling horror film experience in years.\n",

The Starck Club was world renowned designer Philippe Starck's first major design in North America. In addition, it was ground zero for the popularization of the dance drug MDMA, aka ecstasy. 1984! The year of the famous Orwell novel, the year Apple introduced Mac computers via the famous Ridley Scott commercial and the year Ronald Reagan won in a Presidential landslide. In fact, the Republican National Convention was hosted in Dallas, Texas. Also, in Dallas, the seeds were sown for the beginning of the entire rave/ecstasy scene in a night club on the northwest edge of downtown. That place was the notorious Starck Club (so-called because it was the first major project designed by Philippe Starck; it put him on the map in the United States). The Starck Club opened in Dallas on May 12, 1984 and, not long after, hosted the GOP in the form of a \"Starcktari\" party complete with a baby elephant! Ironically, it was actually legal to buy MDMA (aka ecstasy) there; people would put it on their credit cards. However, the DEA stepped in and made it a 'category 1' drug on July 1, 1985. Aside from being ground-zero for the popularization of the designer drug, the club was so much more. Philippe Starck is now a world renowned designer but until his foray in Dallas he was only an up-and-coming Parisian designer virtually unknown outside of France. After the club, he went on to design the Hotel Royalton in New York as well as the SLS Hotel in Beverly Hills in which he currently has an exclusive ten year contract. In addition, the mid '80s brought about a new second British invasion and the birth of new wave music: Dead or Alive, Book of Love, Prince, Grace Jones, Karen Finley and a whole slew of new bands and artists performed there.

At that time, albinos were considered offspring of the Devil and were burnt at the stake. In order to prevent that, her mother used to dye her hair with a natural black colour that with time would discolour and leave a light blue hue (\"azzurro\", in Italian). The tale of Guendalina was passed down verbally until 1600 when a collector of stories put down on paper what now had become legend. Guendalina was different, she was born with albinism, which in that era was a symbol of witches and demons and she would have ended up by being put to death at the stake. Her father hid her in their Castle and her mother dyed her hair in order to protect her. Unfortunately, the sunlight turned her dyed hair blue. Thus was born the myth of \"Azzurrina\". On 21 June in the year 1375, the ball of rags that Azzurrina was playing with ended up in a mound of snow. With a bloodcurdling scream, she disappeared into thin air, without ever being found.

            "ID: 44108, TITLE: Against a Trans Narrative (2008), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: \"Against a Trans Narrative\" primarily functions as a dialog - between friends, cultures and generations - addressing issues of representation, identity-formation, and the various forces that act together to build (or dismantle) communities. Specifically, the film analyzes the construction of trans-masculine communities inside the larger cultural framework. What forms of regulation, self or otherwise, must we partake in to be part of a community, and at what cost? The goal of the video is not to present a cohesive image of trans-masculinity because such a task is impossible, perhaps even irresponsible. The goal is to instigate conversations amongst feminists, queers, transfolks, and anyone else invested in radically shifting the ways in which we construct personal and historical narratives. Sitting somewhere between fiction, nonfiction and experimental film genres, the film is as fragmented and complicated as its subject matter. The audience is presented with disparate narratives, home videos, dramatic reenactments, poetry, and round table conversations where people discuss their reactions to the issues presented in the film, and yet it all flows seamlessly. One can see the influences of Marlon Riggs' \"Tongues Untied\" and Jean Rouch's \"Chronicle of a Summer\" both at work here.

            "ID: 44158, TITLE: Joan Crawford: Always the Star (1996), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: This glamorous and hugely popular actress raised herself from brutal poverty to Academy Award-winning stardom by guts, determination and hard work. During her fifty-year career, she made over eighty films. But her obsessive perfectionism led to the later caricature of coat-hanger-wielding harridan that even the adoration of fans could not counter. Still, she has endured as one of the most popular icons of the movies, an early role model to a million young women who aspired to her image of stylish magnetic power and unquestioned independence. She was born Lucille LeSueur on March 23, 1904 (or 1906) in San Antonio, Texas. Her father soon disappeared and she took the name of her stepfather, calling herself Billie Cassin. When Cassin, too, vanished, Billie did menial work to help her mother and brother survive. Ill-paid sales jobs bought dancing lessons and the clothes she needed to enter amateur contests. Then came a night-club contract as chorus girl - $25-a-week and eight routines a night. And so she made it into show-business, but the humiliations and insecurities of those early years would never entirely leave her. Spotted by an MGM scout, by 1925 she was under contract in Hollywood. She made the usual publicity appearaces and did Exhibition Dancing at night. Her vitality, charm and dancing talents earned her many admirers - including some powerful enough to advance her career, like William Haines, Paul Bern, Jackie Coogan, Sr. and Louis B. Mayer. After bit parts and a small role in the film Pretty Ladies, a studio-sponsored competition found her the name she at first hated: Joan Crawford. As Crawford's acting skills developed, she became known for her independence and her resilience despite some less-than-successful roles. Her vaguely pretty and plump early looks were soon replaced by the svelte, hard-boiled beauty of hollow-cheeks, thick brows and overpainted mouth that would be her permanent image. Her capacity to inspire and wear with flair the creations of the dress designer Adrian was legendary. But most of all, she was known for her hard work on the set. Joan Crawford's personal life was characterized equally by self-discipline and the determination to better herself, banishing forever her unhappy beginnings. Four husbands included actors Douglas Fairbanks, Jr, Franchot Tone, Phillip Terry and businessman Alfred Steele. Plagued by innumerable miscarriages, she adopted four children, one of whose account of Joan's unyielding perfectionism has succeded in blurring memories of the remarkable life and career of a Hollywood immortal. Among Joan Crawford's films from which clips are included: Sally, Irene and Mary, 1925; Our Dancing Daughters, 1928; Grand Hotel, 1932; Dancing Lady, 1933; The Gorgeous Hussy, 1936; The Women, 1939; A Woman's Face, 1941; Mildred Pierce, 1945; Humoresque, 1946; Possessed, 1947; Sudden Fear, 1952; Johnny Guitar, 1954 Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? 1962 and Strait Jacket, 1964.\n",

To him, the traditional system is doomed to failure and can only lead to the generation of seeds and to decline in the quality of products. In answer to a question about plant diseases, Rudolf Steiner explained that in reality it was not the plant first, but the environment and more particularly the soil, which could become sick. The origin of the plants' alleged diseases were to be found in the state of the soil and the environment. Rudolf Steiner's quotes: \"Biodynamic agriculture is an agriculture ensuring the health of soil and plants to provide healthy food for animals and men. It is based on a thorough understanding of the laws of life gained by a qualitative view of the global nature. It believes that nature is now so degraded that it no longer able to heal itself and it is necessary to restore the soil vitality essential for the health of plants, animals and people trough therapeutic processes. The world of wine has rapidly come to understand the stake of this agriculture, the loss of the notion of soil being more important in wine making than in other agricultural productions. Wine growers elaborate their wines extreme accuracy, from their vineyards to their cellars, and it's a job where each and every detail has its importance. Biodynamic farming has widely developed, thank's to the rigor and precision of these charismatic characters who pass on their knowledge with great passion.\n",

            "ID: 44169, TITLE: Above the Ground (2017/I), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: In Hiroshima, contrary to local people's wish, violence and disturbance are shown up especially on August 6th. Protesters, demonstrators and religious groups occupied Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park entirely, taking advantage of that place for their campaigns. The heart of peace in Hiroshima is no longer at peace. Even though media also regularly come to picture, they are obliged to capture precisely the peaceful images of Hiroshima. They just sit down in front of miserable or mourning people and organize grief reactions to integrate themselves into Hiroshima Peace Memorial Day. Most casual viewers of media will follow those artificial pieces, so that there this is a peace gap between media images and the actual situation in Hiroshima. This gap is what represents Hiroshima culture 70 years after the bomb was dropped. The shots in Above the Ground reveal how this is happening and why this exists. To do so, we filmed using 15 cameras applying the methods of visual ethnography. These methods help viewers develop their spiritual and intellectual muscles to the point where they can acquire accurate knowledge of Hiroshima culture. The film has abandoned the historical analogy of Hiroshima city, and instead, selected pieces that fairly represent the various dimensions of contemporary Hiroshima. No one need be rigidly committed to any single approach to the film. Ultimately the documentary offers audiences different paths toward peace culture of Hiroshima.\n",

But thanks to Daniel Raim's lucid and concise Oscar nominated documentary about Robert Boyle, one of Hollywood's best art directors, a general audience now has a chance to savor what these masters of their craft have contributed. Boyle tells stories about working on everything from Hitchcock's \"North by Northwest,\" \"The Birds\" and \"Marnie\" to \"Fiddler on the Roof.\" Boyle is quite eloquent and witty in explaining his craft, and others, including fellow art director Henry Bumstead, are also interviewed. Raim has done an imaginative job of editing production storyboards and sketches with photographs and film segments so that we 'get' what the production designer actually does. The detailed segment on constructing Mt. Rushmore in the studio (thus the film's title!) is fascinating, as we learn more about how actual photos of a location can be skillfully blended with a constructed set. A special highlight is Raim's coverage of \"The Birds,\" in which Raim has Boyle revisit the actual location as film footage from Hitchcock's memorable film is intercut with continuity sketches drawn for Boyle by his draftsman, Harold Michelson. We see a black-and-white line drawing of Tippi Hedren with a bird attacking her, which then becomes that actual shot in the film. Raim's film is a welcome gift to everyone anywhere who wants to know more about what has and continues to make Hollywood Hollywood.\n",

(2008), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: After the stock market crashed in 1929, millions of Americans lost their jobs, their savings and their homes. President Herbert Hoover urged patience and self-reliance: He thought the crisis was just \"a passing incident in our national lives,\" which the federal government wasn't responsible for resolving. In 1932, the Democratic Party's presidential candidate, New York governor Franklin Delano Roosevelt, declared that, indeed, the government could try to make Americans' lives better. \"I pledge myself to a New Deal for the American people,\" he said in his acceptance speech at his party's convention, and he meant it. Over the next nine years, Roosevelt's programs and policies did more than just adjust interest rates, tinker with farm subsidies and create short-term make-work programs. They created a brand-new, if tenuous, political coalition that included white working people, African-Americans and left-wing intellectuals. These people rarely shared the same interests-at least, they rarely thought they did-but they did share a powerful belief that an interventionist government was good for their families, the economy and the nation. Their coalition has splintered over time, but many of the New Deal programs that bound them together are still with us today.\n",

We present a truthful portrait of an unusual life. To this day, Wallis Simpson divides opinion; but whether hated or adored, she will always be the woman who stole a king from the British people and threw their monarchy into crisis. A twice-married American, and then Duchess of Windsor, Wallis Simpson was not permitted to travel to England and was completely shunned by the royal family. For some she is a witch who cast a spell on the handsome prince, while others identify with her because the man she loved gave up everything for her. We attempt to sort the myth from the truth. Without doubt, Wallis was the reason that Edward VIII abdicated the British throne. This made her the most vilified woman of the 20th century. The British public, in particular, were merciless in their contempt and scorn. There were accusations that the marriage was illegal, that she was a nymphomaniac, a whore, even a sex-athlete, who had learned her trade in the brothels of China. Rumours of everything from working for the German Reich's secret service through to having an affair with the Nazi foreign minister von Ribbentrop abounded. But what is the truth? Where does this aversion come from? Could the relationship between Edward and Wallis Simpson even have been a good opportunity for the British government to rid itself of an unpopular monarch? Having grown up in rather modest circumstances, was Wallis striving for financial security? Was she a dangerous adventurer, who used her close relationship with the British king to rise in society? Or was she a victim - caught in a relationship that the entire world was watching? This film presents a truthful portrait of an unusual life.\n",

            "ID: 44379, TITLE: A Walk-Up with Five Stories (1999), GENRE: short, DESCRIPTION: \"A Walk-Up with Five Stories\" was not a planned film. In 1998 I moved to NYC after writing my first screenplay in the University. I came to make a film. After spending three days on the train, I began work writing my second screenplay as soon as my feet hit the urban pavement. I had never worked with 16mm film so I decided to enroll in a few classes at Film/Video Arts. Though the old F/V A had some of the nastiest carpets in the film underground, they had teachers, fellow students, flat beds and Bolexes. What more did an aspiring filmmaker need? The original 1300 feet of film I shot while at F/V A was intended for \"Divisions,\" the screenplay I began after arriving in NYC. Of course, this is where the unplanned became the planned. The organic nature of film grew from one of those editing flats where the lights never worked. They say Warhol edited all his films in there. The creation would take place. I knew \"Divisions\" was a long way from completion and that my budget could not afford for much more film. In the meantime I figured it would be good to have a piece to show. After cutting the film for so long, another story came from the footage. I had shot some scenes for \"Divisions\" where YOUR MAN climbs the stairs and sees VENUS getting busy with another guy. I also had shot some of the other sequences for the film. At the time, I lived in a walk-up with five stories. I showed the work print sans soundtrack at the end of class with F/V A. From that day on, I would show the film at parties, at my house, in cars, wherever. Later I would take it down to WRS (HINT: BEST student discount in all of NYC!) and show it to Marv Salliway. He told me there was one man to see: Jonas Mekas. I dropped the film off with Jonas at the Anthology Film Archives. Of course, I had to call him every other day for the next three months until he watched it. He added it to the schedule as a Friday and Saturday night screening. My first film premiere! The film would then make its way to a packed house in my hometown on New Year's Eve. From there, it would be exposed to all via festivals and through collec.tv distribution.\n",

And while Mario is a singular child, commendably portrayed by the pugilistic Marco Grieco, what turns Antonio Capuano's Mario's War into a fine film is not just this penetrating performance but the sensitive depiction of the new world that envelops this young boy.

Giulia is a special woman who gratefully and bravely embraces her new foster son. As played by the wonderful Valeria Golino (recently seen in Respiro), we recognize her unbending strength and commitment to meeting this huge challenge. Not only does she have to grapple with every obstacle Mario throws at her, but she has to cope with the doubts and hesitation of Sandro (Andrea Renzi), the man she lives with and loves... Hovering uneasily over the film is the issue of making a defiant kid fit into a system that may not suit him. Giulia and Mario are allies in a war to make sure that his individuality survives intact, but they are also occasional antagonists. Capuano's skill at balancing these competing forces is exemplary, turning Mario's War into a complex portrait of a woman and her chosen son.\n",

            "ID: 44784, TITLE: Encounter (2007/II), GENRE: short, DESCRIPTION: A single shot in close-up of moving dishes on a circular conveyor belt in a sushi bar in a London station. In the middle-ground servers prepare the sushi while passengers can be seen hurrying to catch their trains in the background.

In \"Brief Encounter\" two married people meet by accident in a railway station restaurant, fall in love and begin an ultimately doomed relationship. In this video, the station restaurant has been transformed into a sushi bar but it could still serve as a trysting place. The Spielberg reference is due to the fact that the dishes are reminiscent of flying saucers. \"Encounter\" also refers to the globalization of culture represented by a Japanese sushi bar in an English station. The circular movement of the food is analogous to the journeys of the passengers. In the far background a curved station window can be glimpsed that echoes the shape of the bowls.\n",

            "ID: 44805, TITLE: Half Nelson (2006), GENRE: drama, DESCRIPTION: Young Caucasian Dan Dunne teaches history and coaches the girls basketball team at a Brooklyn high school populated primarily by black and Hispanic students. To the chagrin of his superiors, Dan bucks the outlined curriculum of historical facts in favor of the philosophy of historical events, generally discussing the concept of dialectics. As such, he captures the imagination of his students, at least in the classroom. Outside of the classroom, Dan's life is in shambles. He has a distant but cordial relationship with his family. He uses illicit drugs rampantly. Although his former girlfriend Rachel was able to clean up her drug habit, Dan believes that rehab will not work for him. Due to a combination of these issues, he treats women poorly. Thirteen year old Drey is a student in his class and a player on his basketball team. Drey has her own problems. Her parents are divorced, with her father a virtually non-existent figure in her life and her EMT mother generally absent as she is always working to provide for Drey. Her older brother Mike is incarcerated for selling drugs for a local dealer named Frank. Mike took the fall for Frank, who in turn protects Drey whether she wants to be associated with him or not. Dan and Drey's relationship changes when Drey catches Dan, believing he is alone, smoking crack in the girl's locker room bathroom. He is totally stoned. Their resulting friendship, which is seen as inappropriate by the few who know, is based on each being unable to deal with their own life, but feeling like they can be at least a minor salvation in the other's life. Dan Dunne is an eighth-grade history teacher in an inner-city school deep in the heart of Brooklyn. He eschews the provided curriculum in favor of off-the-cuff, but deeply heartfelt lectures about the importance of understanding history, rather than just memorizing it. He speaks primarily of dialectics, the tensions between two opposing forces. He is torn between his desire to change the world and his increasingly desperate realization that he can't, at least not in the grand, awe-inspiring ways that he envisioned as an eager, idealistic college student. He started using drugs as a way to escape the pain of life, and it has turned into a crutch that bears increasingly heavy loads of psychological weight. In his classroom, which is populated almost entirely by black and Hispanic students, Dan lectures about how the world is structured into opposing forces, illustrating it at one point by arm-wrestling one of his students. His unorthodox approach inspires them during class, but interestingly enough we don't see its effects outside the classroom. The film focuses on Dan and his relationship with Drey, a 13-year-old student of his who catches him in the bathroom smoking crack after school one day. Drey understands Dan's frustrations with life; she is the child of an overworked single mother whom she barely sees, and spending so much time on her own has made her self-reliant, but also hard on the edges.\n",

Perceptive Faculty 2 is an upward progression from one level of perception to the next. simulated changes in the tape speed permit varying interpretations of a situation: the level of perception is altered when the speed is reduced, doubled or tripled. when the maximum speed is reached, the viewer enters a temporal level which opens up new spatial perceptions. in this state, the various windows detach from the background to form a new, independent space which has been liberated from customary dimensions. similar to photographic effects in which over- or underexposure is employed to create new impressions of perception, the \"time scale\" is manipulated in this work so that the world is portrayed in new \"temporal perspectives\".

            "ID: 44824, TITLE: Bridging the Gap (2013/I), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: The Vienna Boys' Choir, arguably the most famous boys' choir, and one of the oldest boy music group in the world, is a cultural phenomenon. The boys are immensely popular worldwide and sing to sell-out crowds wherever they perform. Curt Faudon's film explores the Choir's universal appeal. In Bridging the Gap the boys discuss on camera why people sing, why they sing. 'Singing makes you grin, you cannot help it,' says one of them, while another volunteers, 'Singing consoles me.' Lukas has to think a bit before he admits to liking wild applause best of all, because that way he knows the choir has done a good job. Ivan cannot think of anything but becoming an opera singer, and Thomas explains how singing makes him feel connected with himself and others. They agree you need to connect with your audience. If you do, you can pretty much bridge any gap. They put the theory to the test, singing to (and with) other children and adults, in New Zealand, in India, in the United States. They demonstrate that singing overcomes differences between people, but also space, and ultimately time. The camera follows the boys at home and on their international tours, discovering new songs en route. The boys are seen rehearsing and performing with musicians from around the world. Bridging the gap between religions, the boys sing Hindu, Apache, Ringatu, and Christian spiritual music. We witness auditions in Japan, and Singapore, we see the boys rehearse alone and in groups, we see and hear their voices and their personalities develop, we watch them perform. We get a good idea of how difficult it is to get ready for a performance, and how much work the boys and their tutors and coaches have to put in. Bridging the Gap affords the viewer a privileged look backstage; we experience how music is made: by making music visible, the film bridges the gap between the performers and their audience.\n",

In 1997, Albin Johnson of South Carolina founded a small club for fans of the Star Wars Trilogy who owned authentic costumes of the film's Imperial forces. Consisting of icons like Stormtroopers and Darth Vader, he called it the Fighting 501st Legion. Little did he know that this initially small group of people would soon grow to encompass individuals of all walks of life, ages, social backgrounds, nationalities and cultures. Within only 5 years, the club increased to 2000 members and added another 2500 to its roster by 2006. Albin has led the group to become not only an icon in the Sci-Fi scene and among Star Wars fans throughout the world, but also a high profile media sensation.

Derek and Laura Cabrera, RE:Thinking takes a systems thinking approach both to exploring the very purpose of education and in imagining what is needed to prepare young people for an uncertain world.\n",

            "ID: 53227, TITLE: Ariodante (1996), GENRE: music, DESCRIPTION: On 8th January 1735 at the Covent Garden in London, Georg Friederich Handel presented his new opera Ariodante on a libretto by Antonio Salvi adapted by Paolo Rolli and inspired by Ariosto. The opera did not immediately win public favour and thus failed to furnish a definitive solution for the fate of Handel's company, but with time it was to be understood and appreciated and has remained on playbills among the more successful and interesting titles. Handel's particular attention to the expressive aspect was most probably the reason for the opera's limited commercial success: the characters fit only partially into the customary types of opera of the day. The tendency to formulate autonomous patterns in the expressive genre is also underlined by an illustrious contemporary, John Mainwaring, in his Memoirs of the life of George Frederick Handel. Extraordinary is also the strength of the instrumental composition, which again in Ariodante is intended now as support to the voices now as independent, coinciding with steps in the sinfonia and with delightful dance motives. In this production of the Spoleto Festival, at his 50th anniversary, Alan Curtis conducts the Complesso Barocco and an extraordinarily agile Ann Hallenberg in the title role. Scenes and costumes by John Pascoe. Together with Giulio Cesare and Rodelinda, Ariodante is considered one of Handel's operatic masterpieces. It was composed for London's Covent Garden theatre, where it was first performed on January 8th, 1735. Alan Curtis and his Complesso Barocco rank among the best specialists in baroque music, and regularly record for Virgin, Deutsche Grammophone and now also for Dynamic. Thanks to the interesting and personal touch of the director Alan Pascoe, this production comes across as a very credible show. Pascoe and Curtis, incidentally, already gained remarkable success with Vivaldi's Ercole sul Termodonte, published by Dynamic in 2007\n",
            "ID: 53228, TITLE: CUT: Teens and Self Injury (2007), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: CUT: Teens and Self Injury provides an intimate look at a problem that affects thousands of young people, their families and friends. Resisting sensationalism and graphic images, the film draws its power from the voices of the teens themselves. They talk about the sources of their cutting: their experiences of alienation and inadequacy, their deep desire to feel, their sense of cutting as a part of the world they can control. They describe the resistance and denial that often greets their attempts to talk about their feelings and actions. And, crucially, they describe the ways in which they began to confront, and often overcome, their urge toward self-harm. Interviews with parents and mental health professionals help establish broader contexts for understanding the extent of the problem and ways of addressing it. Weaving in artworks created by the teens and music about self-injury, CUT's highlights include rock icon Shirley Manson's moving testimony concerning her own cutting. Fully aware of the extent of the problem, the film incorporates the perspectives of males and females, whites blacks and Asian Americans. Urgent, searching, and profoundly moving, CUT issues a call to bring the problem of self-injury out of the shadows and reminds us that the first step towards healing is an honest acknowledgement of reality.\n",

How far can one stretch before one can no longer and must no longer submit to these societal restrictions? The essence, nay the gist of the point is that anti-social, in-humane or rather primal nature in some circumstances will inevitably be released. When the pain of daily life gnaws through ones moral fiber to the point of numbing ones senses. When the mind begins to dull and must be awakened or die; a jolt is needed. And it is at this point that Senor Javier Munoz breached his snapping point thus moving him forward into another form of life that he was and is entirely unprepared for. His life of mediocrity and want has ended. His exploration has begun.\n",
            "ID: 53290, TITLE: Nostradamus: Election 2016 (2016), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: While many agree that Nostradamus predicted some of the most tumultuous and destructive events in history (including World War II and 9/11), there is a growing body of evidence that points to Nostradamus predicting the winner of this year's Presidential Election. Nostradamus consistently references an epic battle between a \"Masculine Woman\" who is also referred to as \"the Queen\", or \"The Blonde One\", and one who is a \"great shameless, audacious bawler.\" He also refers to a \"rigged election\", a term that has become a hallmark of the 2016 election. Now by breaking Nostradamus' code and searching for clues we can reveal that not only does he predict the outcome of this year's battle between Hillary Clinton and Donald Drumpf, but he also foretells a time of great trouble in the wake of this historic election.\n",

In 1942, as World War II invaded Alaska, Aleut Americans were taken from their homes and removed to abysmal government camps 1,500 miles away. Death was ever-present in the camps. An estimated 10 percent of the men, women and children sent to the camps would die there-a death rate comparable to that suffered by Americans in foreign prisoner of war camps. As the Aleuts prayed for deliverance, \"friendly forces\" looted their homes and churches in the Aleutian and Pribilof islands. Those who survived would fight for their rights-in the nation's courts and on Capitol Hill. In a historic action-one that continues to influence our lives and our nation's ideals-Aleuts joined Japanese Americans in seeking wartime reparations from the federal government. Aleut Americans ultimately prevailed. Richly textured with all the elements of great human drama-war, suffering, sacrifice, faith, self-discovery and renewal-Aleut Story is a poignant and timely film about the least known chapters of the American civil rights experience. Filmed on location in Alaska and Washington, DC on 35mm and S16mm, Aleut Story moves viewers through a distant landscape with mesmerizing cinematography, presents rare archival images and contemporary interviews.

I must have over 100 Duke videos/cds dating back to mid '80s right up until the latest road race ones. As an MGP competitor in 05 (silver rep) I had slightly a different view point from perhaps someone who hasn't competed... I have to say it was fantastic, so well informed, factual and really captures the races in all the aspects. We still race the short circuits but I suppose it's true, you can never really explain until you have done it.

            "ID: 53423, TITLE: Hijos de la guerra (2007), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: Hijos de la Guerra (\"Children of the War\") is a feature-length documentary film about the world's largest and most violent street gang: the Mara Salvatrucha, also known as MS-13. The MS-13 gang spans the Americas with an estimated membership of 100,000 people across the United States and Central America. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has declared the MS-13 the fastest growing and most violent street gang in the United States. The Mara Salvatrucha was formed in Los Angeles in the late 1980s by Salvadoran Civil War refugees as a means to protect themselves from rival ethnic gangs. The newly formed gang channeled the widespread trauma of a genocidal civil war on entire generations of orphaned and abandoned children into fanatical violence. This formed the basis for MS's explosive growth. MS-13 has since become a growing threat throughout 33 states in the U.S. and in every country in Central America. The institution of systematic and increasingly stern U.S. deportation policies, along with forceful Salvadoran armed repression of the members, has radicalized the group. Instead of tempering the gang's influence, these policies have propelled the gang into a powerful, aggressive and multiplying force that seems increasingly difficult to control. Through a series of over 80 interviews (including gang members across several countries, the gang's founders, experts and academics) and powerful footage inside jails in El Salvador, gang-infested neighborhoods of Los Angeles, and Salvadoran communities across the East Coast of the United States, the film sheds light on the root personal reasons for gang membership, the ensuing explosion of fratricidal violence as well as the complex role of social and government policy in both containing and aggravating gang proliferation. Hijos de la Guerra (\"Children of the War\") is the first feature-length documentary film to tell the story of the MS-13. It addresses the causes and circumstances that have fueled this gang's ominous rise to power.\n",

            "ID: 53435, TITLE: A Way Out (2015/III), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: A WAY OUT is a documentary, which explores how women get out of dangerously abusive relationships. It is essentially a documentary which draws upon the portrait of a woman who traveled a path which took her from nearly being killed by her ex-husband in a brutal attack, through escape, recovery, redemption and heroism. That woman, Kim Donatelle, recounts the details of the day on which she nearly died and describes how her best friend did die when she tried to come to Kim's aid. After a long and painful medical recovery, Kim began to bring herself back into the world of the living. She endured the difficult criminal trial of her attacker and began to put back together the pieces of her life. With almost every reason in the world to give up on her life and her future, Kim Donatelle has instead become an inspirational force in the fight against domestic violence. Her story is one of transcendence. It is the story of how one woman's heroic recovery became a life which has touched the lives of countless other women who have wound up in the darkened world of domestic violence. The story of how she redeemed her life after barely surviving a deadly attack is one which has inspired other women to safely leave dangerous situations. The documentary frames Kim's personal story with recollections of professional women who worked in the field in the early days when domestic violence was understood by almost no one, times when domestic violence was someone else's dirty secret. The documentary neatly details how far society and the legal system have come from then to now. The documentary also contains revelations from those who work in the domestic violence arena every day, from law enforcement officers to career prosecutors, who talk about the special problems, which are inherent in these kinds of legal cases. Through the voice of Laurel Lynch, the head of HOPE services, we get an inside look at what is available to women who leave their abusive traps. A WAY OUT is a documentary, which combines the inspiration and heroism of one woman's story with insight on how to find a way out of dangerous relationships.\n",

            "ID: 53469, TITLE: Power and Terror: Noam Chomsky in Our Times (2002), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: Whether Noam Chomsky, the MIT linguist and political philosopher, is the most important intellectual alive, as the New York Times once famously called him, is open for debate. But without a doubt, Chomsky, now 73, is one of the most straight-talking and committed dissidents of our time. A steadfast critic of United States foreign policy for decades, in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11th, his profile took a quantum leap as he provided much-needed analysis and historical perspective to concerned citizens throughout the world. In the months that followed, he gave dozens of talks on four continents, conducted scores of interviews, and wrote a book 9-11 that was published in 22 countries and became a surprise bestseller in many of them, including Japan. Chomsky's voice may be unpopular, but his incisive arguments, based on decades of research and analysis, are heard and considered in this chronicle comprised of interview footage, and various talks he's given. Chomsky places the terrorist attacks in the context of American foreign intervention throughout the postwar decades--in Vietnam, Central America, the Middle East, and elsewhere. Beginning with the fundamental principle that the exercise of violence against civilian populations is terror, regardless of whether the perpetrator is a well-organized band of Muslim extremists, or the most powerful state in the world. Chomsky, in stark and uncompromising terms, challenges the United States to apply to its own actions the moral standards it demands of others.\n",

            "ID: 53474, TITLE: New Life in Congo (2012), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: The province of South Kivu in The Democratic Republic of the Congo, is one of the poorest regions in the world, despite the fact that it is very rich when it comes to natural resources. Plagued by (civil) wars, the region hasn't been stable in decades. 'Your child is only yours', so says a well-known Congolese saying, 'when it reaches it's fifth year'. Mother and child very often die during the labor. The documentary 'New life in Congo' shows that it doesn't have to stay like that. A new approach in the development assistance that does not give a bag of money to the failing government anymore, but instead encourages the local people to take faith into own hands, and more important to take responsibility, has already changed the health care system. The new method is called PBF, short for Performance Based Financing, and it implies that the payment for the work that has been realized, is made afterwards. In the documentary, Paul Hegeman follows two women. The 23-year-old Byenda who just gave birth to her third child, and the 31-year-old Aurelie, who is expecting her seventh child. Both women live a life that is threatened by lack of food, and the sexual violence against women in this region of the Congo. Nevertheless, they seem optimistic and continue to fight for a better existence. Now with the revolution in the health care system, the women are supported by doctors and nurses, and although much has yet to be done, they can at least bare their child in health. In the Congolese province South Kivu that has been plagued by (civil) wars, poverty and sexual violence, a revolutionary new approach of development assistance called PBF (Performance Based Financing) is introduced in the health care system to improve the living conditions for the most vulnerable group of the region: pregnant women.\n",

            "ID: 53510, TITLE: Megaroof: Rebuilding BC Place (2012), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: For approximately the first quarter century of its life, BC Place Stadium in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, boasted the largest air supported dome in the world. The fabric roof was held up by sixteen fans, which, if there was ever a power failure, would cause the roof to deflate. During a windstorm on January 5, 2007, a large hole was ripped into the fabric roof. Beyond the immediate issue of repairing the roof, this incident led to authorities contemplating the future of aging BC Place: whether a similar roof should replace the existing, whether another roof design was in order for twenty-first century thinking, or whether a new facility should be built in its place. They decided on the middle option, wanting a retractable roof. The design conceived was revolutionary and never having done before: thirty-six masts erected on the perimeter of the concrete structure supporting the equivalent of eighteen suspension cables across the diameter, which would at its core balance a central node, onto which the new fabric retractable part of the roof would be housed. This design was predicated on everything being in balance, as if something was off kilter, it would throw off the entire equilibrium of the structure. As it was only so far realized in computer modeling, any glitch along the way could result in disaster. The eighteen month project is largely told from the perspective of three people: 'David Campbell (XVI)' (qv), the designer, who had to oversee every aspect of the project to ensure it met his visions technically and aesthetically; 'Dan Bock' (qv), the project manager, whose job was increasingly difficult over time as it got more and more complex with the erection of each successive mast and each successive cable; and 'Brian Griffin (XII)' (qv), BC Place's Director of Operations, who could not afford any delay as he needed the facility open for two back-to-back events on the day promised.\n",

Peron together with the Austrian Scientist Ronald Richter, stated that on February 16th 1951, in the remote Huemul Island, in the Argentine Patagonia, the first controlled nuclear fusion of history was performed.

            "ID: 53605, TITLE: Across the Border (1982), GENRE: short, DESCRIPTION: In Across the Border, filmmaker Dana Plays expresses her lifelong commitment to the culture of Latin America. More specifically, her film offers the viewer an unusual insight into the complex relationship between the people of El Salvador and the United States government. Completed in 1982, during a period in which many American artists were trying to convey their anger with their own country's politics. Across the Border transcends the conventions of social documentary as we have come to know it through public television. Instead, Plays manipulates visual elements that compose the image through coloring and fragmentation. She uses this process of deconstruction to lead to a greater understanding of those \"man-made\" constructs that are responsible for the oppression she has witnessed. But Plays' message is hardly dogmatic. The subtlety of her collage-like style suggests a very open message, giving the viewer the opportunity to enter the work as a thinking human being rather than a receptacle of one person's point of view. Dana Plays' personal involvement with the people of El Salvador follows in the tradition of a cross cultural awareness expressed by other women filmmakers such as Maya Deren (Haiti), Margaret Meed (Bali, New Guinea) and Chick Strand (Mexico).\n",

When it comes time to settle accounts, the indebted person almost always finds that the wood he has cut doesn't fulfill his debt obligation, and he has to borrow more money to return to the forest to continue cutting. This permanent cycle of debt permits actors from outside these indigenous communities to maintain control over the extraction of wood and provides them with a free source of labour in the exploitation of these resources. This system is practised especially in remote areas where systems of patronage have replaced the state, and where colonists with a market-based economic logic come into contact with Amazonian indigenous peoples who, historically, have not employed economic logics of saving or hording. The film is a thorough account of this system from testimonies of participants who are involved in it various all levels - indigenous people who are labouring under the system, merchants who lend money and goods in exchange for timber, government officials, NGO operators and indigenous political representatives.\n",

            "ID: 53833, TITLE: How to Be a Model (A 12 Step Plan) (2003), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: The idea of modeling brings to mind the \"glamorous\" high stakes world of the supermodel, complete with fame, fortune, and addictive disorders. But what about the majority of women who make a living on catwalks, billboards and in magazines? Filmmaker, and ex-model, Allison Beda sets out to demystify the profession by mapping the 12 steps on the road to success. Yet, faced with a job that prioritizes virtually unattainable external qualities and promises daily rejection by prospective clients, it quickly becomes apparent that modelling also entails a process of recovery. From New York to Paris and Toronto, Beda follows her friend, international model Peggi Lepage, as she embarks on what will likely be the final year of her career; given that a youthful appearance is a prerequisite, the need to move on to new endeavours is inevitable. With \"go-sees,\" agency meetings and castings, the myriad challenges and contradictions of Peggi's career emerge. Many of the most insightful moments in the documentary arise when Beda must confront her own role as filmmaker. As she finds herself drawn back into the world of modeling, she re-experiences its lure firsthand but also re-discovers its pitfalls. Drawing on interviews with agents, former models and even Peggi's mother (who is protective but supportive), Beda ultimately tests the limits of Peggi's resolve. Their divergent perspectives begin to drive a wedge in their relationship and Peggi threatens to withdraw from the project. The end result is a revealing guide to being a model, filmmaker and friend. Following the work and life of international model Peggi LePage, filmmaker (and ex-model) Allison Beda sets out to demystify the road to success.

I had to send out three of my best people to work him over.\" Santa reminds him that he is also bringing presents for the rest of Eddie's family, so Eddie relents. As the Christmas holiday draws closer, Eddie's family delights in the usual rituals: dressing the tree, decorating, Christmas concerts, etc. But something is bothering Eddie. He is almost constantly in trouble at school, his latest crime being hitting another child for making fun of the letter from Santa that Eddie brought for Show and Tell. His teacher, Betty Schmall, is mystified and powerless to help the boy. Edward's father Brian is facing his own troubles at work. While hosting a home-cooked meal with his boss, Mr. Barlow, Brian learns that his position at a model aircraft company may be in jeopardy. Brian's fifteen-year-old daughter Maureen, already miserable and further dismayed to see that her father is unwilling to fight harder to keep his job, sneaks out and runs away.

(Eddie has always assumed that when school got out teachers went back to their planet.) Even Eddie can't miss the sparks that fly between his father and his teacher. Too weird. Christmas morning dawns as magically as Eddie has ever dreamed. Mr. Claus has brought everything everyone wanted... it seems. In the midst of the present-opening revelry, Brian's friends and co-workers Tim Grimm and Connie Chappell arrive and invite everyone to a party -- which they're holding at Brian's house because he needs cheering up. Brian's protests are easily overruled, and a few hours later the house is filled with laughter. Connie's teenage son Courtney romances Maureen in one corner while Connie, Tim, and Brian read aloud funny entries in the company's \"Indecent Proposal\" contest, in which the person with the most entertaining story about a marriage proposal wins a thousand dollars. Eddie just eats. Surprise guests turn out to be Betty Schmall and Shannon Lunt, a family friend of Betty's and a classmate of Eddie's (and his secret crush). More sparks between Brian and Betty, and more weirding out by Edward. In the year that follows, Edward watches his family struggle with anger, sadness, and loss. On a family visit to their mother, Maureen refuses to even get out of the car\" Ingrid's scary devotion to violent video games and her disturbing habit of destroying her toys -- usually by hitting them with a big rock -- grows. Eddie tells every detail to Santa Claus, who always writes back... until one day he doesn't. And things start to fall apart. Edward's school problems escalate to the point where Betty Schmall demands a parent-teacher conference. Santa merely forgets to write, but Eddie doesn't know that. Eddie finally asks the question that all children ask sooner or later: Is Santa Claus a fake? Santa does his best to reassure the boy, but Eddie decides that only one thing will convince him that Santa is not a fake: a real miracle. That miracle -- and how it tests both Santa and Eddie's faith in everything that Christmas is all about -- may prove too big for even Santa to give.\n",

The crowds outside the hall were so thick Sinatra couldn't get out of the building. But Garrett was there, camera in hand; making the first contact with an artist he was to photograph for many years to come. In 1946, Murray Garrett arrived in Hollywood. His association with Sinatra was rekindled and he went on to work as personal and professional photographer not only to Sinatra, but Bob Hope, Elsa Lanchester, Charles Laughton, Red Skelton, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton among many, many others. The path of Garrett's life in Hollywood had been drawn. He was destined to capture images that stand today as an aide memoir to the golden age of the entertainment industry. His body of work, if only in small part, is preserved in the best selling photo collections 'Hollywood Candid' and 'Hollywood Moments' published by Abrams and Co. In Focus: The Hollywood Lens Of Murray Garrett features these images, shot by a veteran industry photographer, working from the box seats. In the body of this documentary special for television, we are privy to the first hand stories of his adventures supported by parallel interviews with the stars he captured and a select host of family, friends and colleagues including Honorary Mayor of Hollywood Johnny Grant, Comedian Phyllis Diller, Dick Martin, Beverly Garland, Don Knotts and A.C. Lyles as well as Charles Champlin, Bob Thomas, Terry Moore and Morgan Woodward. \"In Focus: ...Murray Garrett\" is firmly rooted in the perspective that Garrett's work is testimony to an era. Unique to the phenomena known as Hollywood in its heyday... the work of a photo journalistic artist, who was the support structure to this one-of-a-kind industry. It was through Garrett's work that the personal images and the professional image, which the studios created for their stars, were presented to the public. In Murray's own words, \"We added the flashbulbs to the image of Hollywood.\" And it's true - even today, it's almost impossible to envision the 'glamour' of Hollywood without seeing flashbulbs. The momentary capture of life - the brief bit of 'spotlight' that gave twinkle to the stars in an unobtainable heaven called Hollywood. That spark was created by Murray Garrett. What Jack Warner and Louis B. Mayer did for the public image of such stars as Bette Davis and Joan Crawford - Murray Garrett did for the public image of an industry. A truly amazing, unique, visual and vital contribution to the last century.\n",

How does this building from the 12th Century stands in South Florida if the American continent was not discovered until the 15th Century? This documentary, will trace the Ancient Spanish Monastery's rich history, painstaking restoration and its invaluable significance not only to the South Florida community, but to our nation and the whole world. It is an important historic monument, whose story has to be narrated to our people and to our national and international visitors. The story around this building includes: kings (Alphonso VII & Alphonso VIII of Spain), churches (monasteries), its' community, and the ambition of one man who brought the building stone by stone from Spain to America, Mr. William Randolph Hearst. Arthur Bynes was the man who found the Monastery and sold it to Hearst. Once in New York, the building was forgotten for 25 years in one of Hearst's warehouses until it was bought and put together by Florida developers who wanted it as a tourist attraction. Due to the fact that the blue prints of the old Monastery were lost, 11,000 boxes of stones were assembled by Allen Carswell who had knowledge of medieval times' construction. The developers failed in their purpose of making the structure a tourist attraction. In 1962, the Episcopal Church intervenes and buys the building to give it the spiritual place that it deserved. However, in 1964, they could not afford the expenses of the property anymore and were forced to close the doors. At this time, a retired Colonel and member of the parish bought the mortgage, fixed the building, and donated it to the Episcopal Church. To help us embrace the story, we have a dedicated group of professionals that will share their knowledge with us; Rev. Fox, Director of the Monastery; Lili Arger, tour guide of the Monastery; Alfredo Granado, Medieval Times Historian; Antolin Carbonel, Architect; Father Francis from the Cistercian Order of The Monastery of The Holy Spirit, Georgia; Hoyt Fields, Director of Hearst Castle in San Simmeon, California; and Jose Miguel Merino de Cáceres, Architect, Historian and Restorer from Madrid University, Spain. The Ancient Spanish Monastery is a topic of great interest to viewers; therefore, to produce a film that is entertaining, cultural, and informative, using the tools of good pacing, clear writing, and crisp editing, will make this project not only attractive to our local viewers, but also attractive to our national audience.\n",

For the first time in history, we have the technological means to save our entire past, yet it seems to be going up in smoke. Will we suffer from collective amnesia? This VPRO Backlight documentary tracks down the amnesiac zeitgeist starting at the Royal Tropical Institute, whose world-famous 250-year old library was lost to budget cuts. 400.000 Books and 20.000 magazines were saved from the shredder by Dr. Ismail Serageldin, director of the world-famous Library of Alexandria, who is turning the legendary library of classical antiquity into a new knowledge hub for the digital world.

A five-year-old boy finds a purse full of money. He and his friends are now faced with the choice of using it to buy their favorite sweets or trying to find the owner. Honestly prevails, but their fat neighbor Ivanova, the purse's owner, found by children after their violent inner struggle, cannot appreciate their gesture and kicks up a row over the two leva (one dollar) that have been spent on cakes. In the second novella 'Violin Concerto' two boys mount an ingenious defend against the far-fetched ambitions of their parents: a kid, unwilling to become a musician, is forced to play by his ambitious mother. Children, however, are smart, inventive and do not give up readily. Another one attends violin lessons on place of the first who prefers to paint, but whose mother does not realize where his talent really lies. The deception is eventually discovered. The little culprits are punished, but they have gained a genuine friendship.\n",
